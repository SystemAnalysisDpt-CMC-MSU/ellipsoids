function F = cut(varargin)
%CUT Defines a cut constraint
%   
% The syntax for CUT is exactly the same as the
% syntax for SET. In fact, the result from CUT is
% a SET object.
%
% The difference between a ordinary constraint and 
% a cut constraint is that the CUT will not be used
% in the solution of the upper bound problem in a
% global solver, but only in the relxation for the 
% lower problem.
%
%    See also   SET
