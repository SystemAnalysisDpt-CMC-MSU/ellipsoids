\section{Additional Software}
Some routines of the {\it Ellipsoidal Toolbox}, namely,
\begin{itemize}
\item {\tt contains}
\item {\tt distance}
\item {\tt ellintersection\_ia}
\item {\tt ellunion\_ea}
\item {\tt intersect}
\item {\tt intersection\_ia}
\item {\tt isinside}
\end{itemize}
require solving convex programming problems.
We use YALMIP (\cite{yalmip}, \cite{yalmiphp}) as an
interface to an external optimization solver.
YALMIP supports a large variety of optimization packages.
One of them, SeDuMi (\cite{sedumi}, \cite{sedumihp}) is distributed
along with {\it ET}.
The user is free to choose any other optimization solver so long
as it is supported by YALMIP.
The list of supported optimization packages can be
obtained from \cite{yalmiphp}.

Both YALMIP and SeDuMi are included in the {\it ET} distribution, so you
do not need to download them separately. However, if you have them already
installed, or wish to install them independently of {\it ET}, you should
download the lite version of {\it ET}.


\section{Installation and Quick Start}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Go to
\newline
{\tt http://code.google.com/p/ellipsoids}
\newline
and download the {\it Ellipsoidal Toolbox} or its lite version stripped
of YALMIP and SeDuMi.
\item Unzip the distribution file into the directory where you would like
the toolbox to be.
\item Read the copyright notice.
\item In MATLAB command window change the working directory to the one where
you unzipped the toolbox and type
\newline
{\tt >> install}
\item At this point, the directory tree of the {\it Ellipsoidal Toolbox} is
added to the MATLAB path list. In order to save the updated path list,
in your MATLAB window menu go to {\tt File} $\rightarrow$ {\tt Set Path...} and
click {\tt Save}.
\item To get an idea of what the toolbox is about, type
\newline
{\tt >> ell\_demo1}
\newline
This will produce a demo of basic {\it ET} functionality: how to create
and manipulate ellipsoids.
\newline
Type
\newline
{\tt >> ell\_demo2}
\newline
to learn how to plot ellipsoids and hyperplanes in 2 and 3D.
\newline
For a quick tutorial on how to use the toolbox for reachability analysis
and verification, type
\newline
{\tt >> ell\_demo3}
\end{enumerate}
