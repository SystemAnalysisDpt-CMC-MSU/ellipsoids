\section{Additional Software}
Some routines of the {\it Ellipsoidal Toolbox}, namely,
\begin{itemize}
\item {\tt distance}
\item {\tt intersect}
\item {\tt intersection\_ia}
\item {\tt isinside}
\end{itemize}
require solving semidefinite programming (SDP) problems.
We use CVX (\cite{cvxhp}) as an
interface to an external SDP solver. CVX as a more reliable toolbox
for solving SDP problems of high dimensionality. CVX - Matlab-based
convex modeling framework. CVX distribution includes two freeware
solvers: SeDuMi(\cite{sedumi}, \cite{sedumihp})
and SDPT3. SeDuMi  is distributed
along with {\it ET}. 
\newline
MPT as a toolbox that defines polytope class
used in {\it ET}.
\newline
These tools aren't included in the {\it ET} distribution. 
So, you need to download them separately. 



\section{Installation and Quick Start}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Go to
\newline
{\tt http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/\~{ }akurzhan/ellipsoids}
\newline
and download the {\it Ellipsoidal Toolbox} or its lite version stripped
of YALMIP and SeDuMi.
\item Unzip the distribution file into the directory where you would like
the toolbox to be.
\item Read the copyright notice.
\item In MATLAB command window change the working directory to the one where
you unzipped the toolbox and type
\verbmcodef[Installation]{mcodesnippets/s_chapter04_section01_snippet01.m}
\item At this point, the directory tree of the {\it Ellipsoidal Toolbox} is
added to the MATLAB path list. In order to save the updated path list,
in your MATLAB window menu go to {\tt File} $\rightarrow$ {\tt Set Path...} and
click {\tt Save}.
\item To get an idea of what the toolbox is about, type
\verbmcodef[Basic functionality]{mcodesnippets/s_chapter04_section01_snippet02.m}

This will produce a demo of basic {\it ET} functionality: how to create
and manipulate ellipsoids.

Type

\verbmcodef[Plot ellypsoids and hyperplanes]{mcodesnippets/s_chapter04_section01_snippet03.m}
to learn how to plot ellipsoids and hyperplanes in 2 and 3D.
\newline
For a quick tutorial on how to use the toolbox for reachability analysis
and verification, type

and verification]{mcodesnippets/s_chapter04_section01_snippet04.m}
