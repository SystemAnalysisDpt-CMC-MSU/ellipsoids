Although some of the operations with ellipsoids are present in the
commercial Geometric Bounding Toolbox \cite{VERES_KUNSEVICH_VALYI_HERMSMEYER_WALL_GEOMETRIC_BOUNDING_TOOLBOX, GEOMETRIC_BOUNDING_TOOLBOX_HOMEPAGE}, the
ellipsoid-related functionality of that toolbox is rather limited.

{\it Ellipsoidal Toolbox} is the first free MATLAB package that
implements ellipsoidal calculus and uses ellipsoidal methods
for reachability analysis of continuous- and discrete-time affine
systems, continuous-time linear systems with disturbances and switched
systems, whose dynamics changes at known times.
The reach set computation for hybrid systems whose guards are hyperplanes
or polyhedra is not implemented explicitly, but the tool for such computation
exists, namely, the operations of intersection of ellipsoid with hyperplane
and ellipsoid with halfspace.
