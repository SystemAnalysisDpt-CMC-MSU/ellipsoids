<h1>Introduction<a class="headerlink" href="#introduction" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>Research on dynamical and hybrid systems has produced several methods
for verification and controller synthesis. A common step in these
methods is the reachability analysis of the system. Reachability
analysis is concerned with the computation of the reach set in a way
that can effectively meet requests like the following:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>For a given target set and time, determine whether the reach set and
the target set have nonempty intersection.</li>
<li>For specified reachable state and time, find a feasible initial
condition and control that steers the system from this initial
condition to the given reachable state in given time.</li>
<li>Graphically display the projection of the reach set onto any
specified two- or three-dimensional subspace.</li>
</ol>
<p>Except for very specific classes of systems, exact computation of reach
sets is not possible, and approximation techniques are needed. For
controlled linear systems with convex bounds on the control and initial
conditions, the efficiency and accuracy of these techniques depend on
how they represent convex sets and how well they perform the operations
of unions, intersections, geometric (Minkowski) sums and differences of
convex sets. Two basic objects are used as convex approximations:
polytopes of various types, including general polytopes, zonotopes,
parallelotopes, rectangular polytopes; and ellipsoids.</p>
<p>Reachability analysis for general polytopes is implemented in the Multi
Parametric Toolbox (MPT) for Matlab Kvasnica et al. (2004;
“Multi-Parametric Toolbox Homepage”). The reach set at every time step
is computed as the geometric sum of two polytopes. The procedure
consists in finding the vertices of the resulting polytope and
calculating their convex hull. MPT’s convex hull algorithm is based on
the Double Description method Motzkin et al. (1953) and implemented in
the CDD/CDD+ package (“CDD/CDD+ Homepage”). Its complexity is
<span class="math">\(V^n\)</span>, where <span class="math">\(V\)</span> is the number of vertices and <span class="math">\(n\)</span> is
the state space dimension. Hence the use of MPT is practicable for low
dimensional systems. But even in low dimensional systems the number of
vertices in the reach set polytope can grow very large with the number
of time steps. For example, consider the system,</p>
<div class="math">
\[x_{k+1} = Ax_k + u_k ,\]</div>
<p>with</p>
<div class="math">
\[\begin{split}A=\left[
\begin{array}{cc}
\cos 1 &amp; -\sin 1\\
\sin 1 &amp; \cos 1
\end{array}
\right],\ u_k \in \{u\in {\bf R}^2 ~|~ \|u\|_{\infty}\leqslant1\},\mbox{ and } x_0 \in \{x\in {\bf R}^2 ~|~ \|x\|_{\infty}\leqslant1\}.\end{split}\]</div>
<p>Starting with a rectangular initial set, the number of vertices of the
reach set polytope is <span class="math">\(4k + 4\)</span> at the <span class="math">\(k\)</span>th step.</p>
<p>In <span class="math">\(d/dt\)</span> (“$d/dt$ Homepage”), the reach set is approximated by
unions of rectangular polytopes E.Asarin et al. (2000).</p>
<div class="figure align-center" style="width: 50%">
<img alt="approximation" src="_images/ddt.png" />
<p class="caption">Reach set approximation by union of rectangles.</p>
</div>
<p>The algorithm works as follows. First, given the set of initial
conditions defined as a polytope, the evolution in time of the
polytope’s extreme points is computed (figure [ddtfig](a)).
<span class="math">\(R(t_1)\)</span> in figure [ddtfig](a) is the reach set of the system at
time <span class="math">\(t_1\)</span>, and <span class="math">\(R[t_0, t_1]\)</span> is the set of all points that
can be reached during <span class="math">\([t_0, t_1]\)</span>. Second, the algorithm computes
the convex hull of vertices of both, the initial polytope and
<span class="math">\(R(t_1)\)</span> (figure [ddtfig](b)). The resulting polytope is then
bloated to include all the reachable states in <span class="math">\([t_0,t_1]\)</span> (figure
[ddtfig](c)). Finally, this overapproximating polytope is in its turn
overapproximated by the union of rectangles (figure [ddtfig](d)). The
same procedure is repeated for the next time interval <span class="math">\([t_1,t_2]\)</span>,
and the union of both rectangular approximations is taken (figure
[ddtfig](e,f)), and so on. Rectangular polytopes are easy to represent
and the number of facets grows linearly with dimension, but a large
number of rectangles must be used to assure the approximation is not
overly conservative. Besides, the important part of this method is again
the convex hull calculation whose implementation relies on the same
CDD/CDD+ library. This limits the dimension of the system and time
interval for which it is feasible to calculate the reach set.</p>
<p>Polytopes can give arbitrarily close approximations to any convex set,
but the number of vertices can grow prohibitively large and, as shown in
Avis, Bremner, and Seidel (1997), the computation of a polytope by its
convex hull becomes intractable for large number of vertices in high
dimensions.</p>
<p>The method of zonotopes for approximation of reach sets Girard (2005;
A.Girard, Guernic, and O.Maler 2006; “MATISSE Homepage”) uses a special
class of polytopes (see (“Zonotope Methods on Wolfgang Kühn Homepage”))
of the form,</p>
<div class="math">
\[Z=\{x \in {\bf R}^n ~|~
x=c+\sum_{i=1}^p\alpha_ig_i,~ -1\leqslant\alpha_i\leqslant1\},\]</div>
<p>wherein <span class="math">\(c\)</span> and <span class="math">\(g_1, ..., g_p\)</span> are vectors in
<span class="math">\({\bf R}^n\)</span>. Thus, a zonotope <span class="math">\(Z\)</span> is represented by its
center <span class="math">\(c\)</span> and ‘generator’ vectors <span class="math">\(g_1, ..., g_p\)</span>. The
value <span class="math">\(p/n\)</span> is called the order of the zonotope. The main benefit
of zonotopes over general polytopes is that a symmetric polytope can be
represented more compactly than a general polytope. The geometric sum of
two zonotopes is a zonotope:</p>
<div class="math">
\[Z(c_1, G_1)\oplus Z(c_2, G_2) = Z(c_1+c_2, [G_1 ~ G_2]),\]</div>
<p>wherein <span class="math">\(G_1\)</span> and <span class="math">\(G_2\)</span> are matrices whose columns are
generator vectors, and <span class="math">\([G_1 ~ G_2]\)</span> is their concatenation. Thus,
in the reach set computation, the order of the zonotope increases by
<span class="math">\(p/n\)</span> with every time step. This difficulty can be averted by
limiting the number of generator vectors, and overapproximating
zonotopes whose number of generator vectors exceeds the limit by lower
order zonotopes. The benefits of the compact zonotype representation,
however, appear to diminish because in order to plot them or check if
they intersect with given objects and compute those intersections, these
operations are performed after converting zonotopes to polytopes.</p>
<p>CheckMate (“CheckMate Homepage”) is a Matlab toolbox that can evaluate
specifications for trajectories starting from the set of initial
(continuous) states corresponding to the parameter values at the
vertices of the parameter set. This provides preliminary insight into
whether the specifications will be true for all parameter values. The
method of oriented rectangluar polytopes for external approximation of
reach sets is introduced in Stursberg and Krogh (2003). The basic idea
is to construct an oriented rectangular hull of the reach set for every
time step, whose orientation is determined by the singular value
decomposition of the sample covariance matrix for the states reachable
from the vertices of the initial polytope. The limitation of CheckMate
and the method of oriented rectangles is that only autonomous (i.e.
uncontrolled) systems, or systems with fixed input are allowed, and only
an external approximation of the reach set is provided.</p>
<p>All the methods described so far employ the notion of time step, and
calculate the reach set or its approximation at each time step. This
approach can be used only with discrete-time systems. By contrast, the
analytic methods which we are about to discuss, provide a formula or
differential equation describing the (continuous) time evolution of the
reach set or its approximation.</p>
<p>The level set method Mitchell and Tomlin (2000; “Level Set Toolbox
Homepage”) deals with general nonlinear controlled systems and gives
exact representation of their reach sets, but requires solving the HJB
equation and finding the set of states that belong to sub-zero level set
of the value function. The method (“Level Set Toolbox Homepage”) is
impractical for systems of dimension higher than three.</p>
<p>Requiem (“Requiem Homepage”) is a Mathematica notebook which, given a
linear system, the set of initial conditions and control bounds,
symbolically computes the exact reach set, using the experimental
quantifier elimination package. Quantifier elimination is the removal of
all quantifiers (the universal quantifier <span class="math">\(\forall\)</span> and the
existential quantifier <span class="math">\(\exists\)</span>) from a quantified system. Each
quantified formula is substituted with quantifier-free expression with
operations <span class="math">\(+\)</span>, <span class="math">\(\times\)</span>, <span class="math">\(=\)</span> and <span class="math">\(&lt;\)</span>. For
example, consider the discrete-time system</p>
<div class="math">
\[x_{k+1} = Ax_k + Bu_k\]</div>
<p>with</p>
<div class="math">
\[\begin{split}A=\left[\begin{array}{cc}
0 &amp; 1\\
0 &amp; 0\end{array}\right]\end{split}\]</div>
<p>and</p>
<div class="math">
\[\begin{split}B=\left[\begin{array}{c}
0\\
1\end{array}\right].\end{split}\]</div>
<p>For initial conditions <span class="math">\(x_0\in\{x\in {\bf R}^2 ~|~ \|x\|_{\infty} \leqslant1\}\)</span> and
controls <span class="math">\(u_k\in\{u\in {\bf R} ~|~ -1\leqslant u\leqslant1\}\)</span>, the
reach set for <span class="math">\(k\geqslant0\)</span> is given by the quantified formula</p>
<div class="math">
\[\{ x\in{\bf R}^2 ~|~ \exists x_0, ~~ \exists k\geqslant0, ~~
\exists u_i, ~ 0\leqslant i\leqslant k: ~~
x = A^kx_0+\sum_{i=0}^{k-1}A^{k-i-1}Bu_i \},\]</div>
<p>which is equivalent to the quantifier-free expression</p>
<div class="math">
\[-1\leqslant[1 ~~ 0]x\leqslant1 ~ \wedge ~ -1\leqslant[0 ~~ 1]x\leqslant1.\]</div>
<p>It is proved in Lafferriere, Pappas, and Yovine (2001) that for
continuous-time systems, <span class="math">\(\dot{x}(t) = Ax(t) + Bu(t)\)</span>, if
<span class="math">\(A\)</span> is constant and nilpotent or is diagonalizable with rational
real or purely imaginary eigenvalues, and with suitable restrictions on
the control and initial conditions, the quantifier elimination package
returns a quantifier free formula describing the reach set. Quantifier
elimination has limited applicability.</p>
<p>The reach set approximation via parallelotopes Kostousova (2001) employs
the idea of parametrization described in Kurzhanski and Varaiya (2000)
for ellipsoids. The reach set is represented as the intersection of
tight external, and the union of tight internal, parallelotopes. The
evolution equations for the centers and orientation matrices of both
external and internal parallelotopes are provided. This method also
finds controls that can drive the system to the boundary points of the
reach set, similarly to Varaiya (1998) and Kurzhanski and Varaiya
(2000). It works for general linear systems. The computation to solve
the evolution equation for tight approximating parallelotopes, however,
is more involved than that for ellipsoids, and for discrete-time systems
this method does not deal with singular state transition matrices.</p>
<p><em>Ellipsoidal Toolbox</em> (ET) implements in MATLAB the ellipsoidal calculus
Kurzhanski and Vályi (1997) and its application to the reachability
analysis of continuous-time Kurzhanski and Varaiya (2000), discrete-time
A. A. Kurzhanskiy (2007), possibly time-varying linear systems, and
linear systems with disturbances A.B.Kurzhanski and P.Varaiya (2001),
for which ET calculates both open-loop and close-loop reach sets. The
ellipsoidal calculus provides the following benefits:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>The complexity of the ellipsoidal representation is quadratic in the
dimension of the state space, and linear in the number of time steps.</li>
<li>It is possible to exactly represent the reach set of linear system
through both external and internal ellipsoids.</li>
<li>It is possible to single out individual external and internal
approximating ellipsoids that are optimal to some given criterion
(e.g. trace, volume, diameter), or combination of such criteria.</li>
<li>We obtain simple analytical expressions for the control that steers
the state to a desired target.</li>
</ul>
<p>The report is organized as follows. Chapter 2 describes the operations
of the ellipsoidal calculus: affine transformation, geometric sum,
geometric difference, intersections with hyperplane, ellipsoid,
halfspace and polytope, calculation of maximum ellipsoid, calculation of
minimum ellipsoid. Chapter 3 presents the reachability problem and
ellipsoidal methods for the reach set approximation. Chapter 4 contains
<em>Ellipsoidal Toolbox</em> installation and quick start instructions, and
lists the software packages used by the toolbox. Chapter 5 describes
structures and objects implemented and used in toolbox. Also it
describes the implementation of methods from chapters 2 and 3 and
visualization routines. Chapter 6 describes structures and objects
implemented and used in the toolbox. Chapter 6 gives examples of how to
use the toolbox. Chapter 7 collects some conclusions and plans for
future toolbox development. The functions provided by the toolbox
together with their descriptions are listed in appendix A.</p>
