\chapter{Introduction}
\label{chap_intro:introduction}\label{chap_intro::doc}\label{chap_intro:welcome-to-ellipsoidal-toolbox-documentation}
Research on dynamical and hybrid systems has produced several methods
for verification and controller synthesis. A common step in these
methods is the reachability analysis of the system. Reachability
analysis is concerned with the computation of the reach set in a way
that can effectively meet requests like the following:
\begin{enumerate}
\item {} 
For a given target set and time, determine whether the reach set and
the target set have nonempty intersection.

\item {} 
For specified reachable state and time, find a feasible initial
condition and control that steers the system from this initial
condition to the given reachable state in given time.

\item {} 
Graphically display the projection of the reach set onto any
specified two- or three-dimensional subspace.

\end{enumerate}

Except for very specific classes of systems, exact computation of reach
sets is not possible, and approximation techniques are needed. For
controlled linear systems with convex bounds on the control and initial
conditions, the efficiency and accuracy of these techniques depend on
how they represent convex sets and how well they perform the operations
of unions, intersections, geometric (Minkowski) sums and differences of
convex sets. Two basic objects are used as convex approximations:
polytopes of various types, including general polytopes, zonotopes,
parallelotopes, rectangular polytopes; and ellipsoids.

Reachability analysis for general polytopes is implemented in the Multi
Parametric Toolbox (MPT) for Matlab ({\hyperref[chap_implement:kvas2004]{{[}KVAS2004{]}}}, {\hyperref[chap_install:mpthp]{{[}MPTHP{]}}}). The reach set at every time step
is computed as the geometric sum of two polytopes. The procedure
consists in finding the vertices of the resulting polytope and
calculating their convex hull. MPT’s convex hull algorithm is based on
the Double Description method {\hyperref[chap_intro:motz1953]{{[}MOTZ1953{]}}} and implemented in
the CDD/CDD+ package {\hyperref[chap_intro:cddhp]{{[}CDDHP{]}}}. Its complexity is
\(V^n\), where \(V\) is the number of vertices and \(n\) is
the state space dimension. Hence the use of MPT is practicable for low
dimensional systems. But even in low dimensional systems the number of
vertices in the reach set polytope can grow very large with the number
of time steps. For example, consider the system,
\begin{gather}
\begin{split}x_{k+1} = Ax_k + u_k ,\end{split}\notag
\end{gather}
with \(A=\left[\begin{array}{cc}\cos 1 & -\sin 1\\ \sin 1 & \cos 1\end{array}\right]\),
\(\ u_k \in \{u\in {\bf R}^2 ~|~ \|u\|_{\infty}\leqslant1\}\),
and \(x_0 \in \{x\in {\bf R}^2 ~|~ \|x\|_{\infty}\leqslant1\}\).

Starting with a rectangular initial set, the number of vertices of the
reach set polytope is \(4k + 4\) at the \(k\)th step.

In \(d/dt\) {\hyperref[chap_intro:ddthp]{{[}DDTHP{]}}}, the reach set is approximated by
unions of rectangular polytopes {\hyperref[chap_intro:asar2000]{{[}ASAR2000{]}}}.
\begin{figure}[htbp]

\caption{Figure 14: Reach set approximation by union of rectangles. Source: adapted from {\hyperref[chap_intro:asar2000]{{[}ASAR2000{]}}}.}\label{chap_intro:ddtfig}\end{figure}

The algorithm works as follows. First, given the set of initial
conditions defined as a polytope, the evolution in time of the
polytope’s extreme points is computed (\hyperref[chap_intro:ddtfig]{figure  \ref*{chap_intro:ddtfig}} (a)).

\(R(t_1)\) in \hyperref[chap_intro:ddtfig]{figure  \ref*{chap_intro:ddtfig}} (a) is the reach set of the system at
time \(t_1\), and \(R[t_0, t_1]\) is the set of all points that
can be reached during \([t_0, t_1]\). Second, the algorithm computes
the convex hull of vertices of both, the initial polytope and
\(R(t_1)\) (\hyperref[chap_intro:ddtfig]{figure  \ref*{chap_intro:ddtfig}} (b)). The resulting polytope is then
bloated to include all the reachable states in \([t_0,t_1]\) (\hyperref[chap_intro:ddtfig]{figure  \ref*{chap_intro:ddtfig}} (c)).
Finally, this overapproximating polytope is in its turn
overapproximated by the union of rectangles (\hyperref[chap_intro:ddtfig]{figure  \ref*{chap_intro:ddtfig}} (d)). The
same procedure is repeated for the next time interval \([t_1,t_2]\),
and the union of both rectangular approximations is taken (\hyperref[chap_intro:ddtfig]{figure  \ref*{chap_intro:ddtfig}} (e,f)),
and so on. Rectangular polytopes are easy to represent
and the number of facets grows linearly with dimension, but a large
number of rectangles must be used to assure the approximation is not
overly conservative. Besides, the important part of this method is again
the convex hull calculation whose implementation relies on the same
CDD/CDD+ library. This limits the dimension of the system and time
interval for which it is feasible to calculate the reach set.

Polytopes can give arbitrarily close approximations to any convex set,
but the number of vertices can grow prohibitively large and, as shown in
{\hyperref[chap_intro:avis1997]{{[}AVIS1997{]}}}, the computation of a polytope by its
convex hull becomes intractable for large number of vertices in high
dimensions.

The method of zonotopes for approximation of reach sets ({\hyperref[chap_intro:gir2005]{{[}GIR2005{]}}}, {\hyperref[chap_intro:gir2006]{{[}GIR2006{]}}}, {\hyperref[chap_intro:mathp]{{[}MATHP{]}}})
uses a special class of polytopes (see {\hyperref[chap_intro:zonohp]{{[}ZONOHP{]}}})
of the form,
\begin{gather}
\begin{split}Z=\{x \in {\bf R}^n ~|~
x=c+\sum_{i=1}^p\alpha_ig_i,~ -1\leqslant\alpha_i\leqslant1\},\end{split}\notag
\end{gather}
wherein \(c\) and \(g_1, ..., g_p\) are vectors in
\({\bf R}^n\). Thus, a zonotope \(Z\) is represented by its
center \(c\) and ‘generator’ vectors \(g_1, ..., g_p\). The
value \(p/n\) is called the order of the zonotope. The main benefit
of zonotopes over general polytopes is that a symmetric polytope can be
represented more compactly than a general polytope. The geometric sum of
two zonotopes is a zonotope:
\begin{gather}
\begin{split}Z(c_1, G_1)\oplus Z(c_2, G_2) = Z(c_1+c_2, [G_1 ~ G_2]),\end{split}\notag
\end{gather}
wherein \(G_1\) and \(G_2\) are matrices whose columns are
generator vectors, and \([G_1 ~ G_2]\) is their concatenation. Thus,
in the reach set computation, the order of the zonotope increases by
\(p/n\) with every time step. This difficulty can be averted by
limiting the number of generator vectors, and overapproximating
zonotopes whose number of generator vectors exceeds the limit by lower
order zonotopes. The benefits of the compact zonotype representation,
however, appear to diminish because in order to plot them or check if
they intersect with given objects and compute those intersections, these
operations are performed after converting zonotopes to polytopes.

CheckMate {\hyperref[chap_intro:cmhp]{{[}CMHP{]}}} is a Matlab toolbox that can evaluate
specifications for trajectories starting from the set of initial
(continuous) states corresponding to the parameter values at the
vertices of the parameter set. This provides preliminary insight into
whether the specifications will be true for all parameter values. The
method of oriented rectangluar polytopes for external approximation of
reach sets is introduced in {\hyperref[chap_intro:stur2003]{{[}STUR2003{]}}}. The basic idea
is to construct an oriented rectangular hull of the reach set for every
time step, whose orientation is determined by the singular value
decomposition of the sample covariance matrix for the states reachable
from the vertices of the initial polytope. The limitation of CheckMate
and the method of oriented rectangles is that only autonomous (i.e.
uncontrolled) systems, or systems with fixed input are allowed, and only
an external approximation of the reach set is provided.

All the methods described so far employ the notion of time step, and
calculate the reach set or its approximation at each time step. This
approach can be used only with discrete-time systems. By contrast, the
analytic methods which we are about to discuss, provide a formula or
differential equation describing the (continuous) time evolution of the
reach set or its approximation.

The level set method ({\hyperref[chap_intro:mit2000]{{[}MIT2000{]}}}, {\hyperref[chap_intro:lsthp]{{[}LSTHP{]}}})
deals with general nonlinear controlled systems and gives
exact representation of their reach sets, but requires solving the HJB
equation and finding the set of states that belong to sub-zero level set
of the value function. The method {\hyperref[chap_intro:lsthp]{{[}LSTHP{]}}} is
impractical for systems of dimension higher than three.

Requiem {\hyperref[chap_intro:reqhp]{{[}REQHP{]}}} is a Mathematica notebook which, given a
linear system, the set of initial conditions and control bounds,
symbolically computes the exact reach set, using the experimental
quantifier elimination package. Quantifier elimination is the removal of
all quantifiers (the universal quantifier \(\forall\) and the
existential quantifier \(\exists\)) from a quantified system. Each
quantified formula is substituted with quantifier-free expression with
operations \(+\), \(\times\), \(=\) and \(<\). For
example, consider the discrete-time system
\begin{gather}
\begin{split}x_{k+1} = Ax_k + Bu_k\end{split}\notag
\end{gather}
with \(A=\left[\begin{array}{cc}0 & 1\\0 & 0\end{array}\right]\)
and \(B=\left[\begin{array}{c}0\\1\end{array}\right]\).

For initial conditions \(x_0\in\{x\in {\bf R}^2 ~|~ \|x\|_{\infty} \leqslant1\}\) and
controls \(u_k\in\{u\in {\bf R} ~|~ -1\leqslant u\leqslant1\}\), the
reach set for \(k\geqslant0\) is given by the quantified formula
\begin{gather}
\begin{split}\{ x\in{\bf R}^2 ~|~ \exists x_0, ~~ \exists k\geqslant0, ~~
\exists u_i, ~ 0\leqslant i\leqslant k: ~~
x = A^kx_0+\sum_{i=0}^{k-1}A^{k-i-1}Bu_i \},\end{split}\notag
\end{gather}
which is equivalent to the quantifier-free expression
\begin{gather}
\begin{split}-1\leqslant[1 ~~ 0]x\leqslant1 ~ \wedge ~ -1\leqslant[0 ~~ 1]x\leqslant1.\end{split}\notag
\end{gather}
It is proved in {\hyperref[chap_intro:laff2001]{{[}LAFF2001{]}}} that for
continuous-time systems, \(\dot{x}(t) = Ax(t) + Bu(t)\), if
\(A\) is constant and nilpotent or is diagonalizable with rational
real or purely imaginary eigenvalues, and with suitable restrictions on
the control and initial conditions, the quantifier elimination package
returns a quantifier free formula describing the reach set. Quantifier
elimination has limited applicability.

The reach set approximation via parallelotopes {\hyperref[chap_intro:kost2001]{{[}KOST2001{]}}} employs
the idea of parametrization described in {\hyperref[chap_intro:kur2000]{{[}KUR2000{]}}}
for ellipsoids. The reach set is represented as the intersection of
tight external, and the union of tight internal, parallelotopes. The
evolution equations for the centers and orientation matrices of both
external and internal parallelotopes are provided. This method also
finds controls that can drive the system to the boundary points of the
reach set, similarly to {\hyperref[chap_intro:var1998]{{[}VAR1998{]}}} and {\hyperref[chap_intro:kur2000]{{[}KUR2000{]}}}.
It works for general linear systems. The computation to solve
the evolution equation for tight approximating parallelotopes, however,
is more involved than that for ellipsoids, and for discrete-time systems
this method does not deal with singular state transition matrices.

\emph{Ellipsoidal Toolbox} (ET) implements in MATLAB the ellipsoidal calculus
{\hyperref[chap_intro:kur1997]{{[}KUR1997{]}}} and its application to the reachability
analysis of continuous-time {\hyperref[chap_intro:kur2000]{{[}KUR2000{]}}}, discrete-time
{\hyperref[chap_reach:var2007]{{[}VAR2007{]}}}, possibly time-varying linear systems, and
linear systems with disturbances {\hyperref[chap_intro:kur2001]{{[}KUR2001{]}}},
for which ET calculates both open-loop and close-loop reach sets. The
ellipsoidal calculus provides the following benefits:
\begin{itemize}
\item {} 
The complexity of the ellipsoidal representation is quadratic in the
dimension of the state space, and linear in the number of time steps.

\item {} 
It is possible to exactly represent the reach set of linear system
through both external and internal ellipsoids.

\item {} 
It is possible to single out individual external and internal
approximating ellipsoids that are optimal to some given criterion
(e.g. trace, volume, diameter), or combination of such criteria.

\item {} 
We obtain simple analytical expressions for the control that steers
the state to a desired target.

\end{itemize}

The report is organized as follows. Chapter 2 describes the operations
of the ellipsoidal calculus: affine transformation, geometric sum,
geometric difference, intersections with hyperplane, ellipsoid,
halfspace and polytope, calculation of maximum ellipsoid, calculation of
minimum ellipsoid. Chapter 3 presents the reachability problem and
ellipsoidal methods for the reach set approximation. Chapter 4 contains
\emph{Ellipsoidal Toolbox} installation and quick start instructions, and
lists the software packages used by the toolbox. Chapter 5 describes
structures and objects implemented and used in toolbox. Also it
describes the implementation of methods from chapters 2 and 3 and
visualization routines. Chapter 6 describes structures and objects
implemented and used in the toolbox. Chapter 6 gives examples of how to
use the toolbox. Chapter 7 collects some conclusions and plans for
future toolbox development. The functions provided by the toolbox
together with their descriptions are listed in appendix A.

\section{Basic Notions}
\label{chap_ellcalc:basic-notions}
We start with basic definitions.

\textbf{Definition.} Ellipsoid \({\mathcal E}(q,Q)\) in
\({\bf R}^n\) with center \(q\) and shape matrix \(Q\) is
the set
\phantomsection\label{chap_ellcalc:equation-ellipsoid}\begin{gather}
\begin{split}{\mathcal E}(q,Q) = \{ x \in {\bf R}^n ~|~ \langle (x-q), Q^{-1}(x-q)\rangle\leqslant1 \},\end{split}\label{chap_ellcalc-ellipsoid}
\end{gather}
wherein \(Q\) is positive definite (\(Q=Q^T\) and
\(\langle x, Qx\rangle>0\) for all nonzero \(x\in{\bf R}^n\)).
Here \(\langle\cdot,\cdot\rangle\) denotes inner
product.

\textbf{Definition.} The support function of a set
\({\mathcal X}\subseteq{\bf R}^n\) is
\begin{gather}
\begin{split}\rho(l~|~{\mathcal X}) = \sup_{x\in{\mathcal X}} \langle l,x\rangle.\end{split}\notag
\end{gather}
In particular, the support function of the ellipsoid \eqref{chap_ellcalc-ellipsoid} is
\phantomsection\label{chap_ellcalc:equation-ellsupp}\begin{gather}
\begin{split}\rho(l~|~{\mathcal E}(q,Q)) = \langle l, q\rangle + \langle l, Ql\rangle^{1/2}.\end{split}\label{chap_ellcalc-ellsupp}
\end{gather}
Although in \eqref{chap_ellcalc-ellipsoid} \(Q\) is assumed to be positive definite,
in practice we may deal with situations when \(Q\) is singular, that
is, with degenerate ellipsoids flat in those directions for which the
corresponding eigenvalues are zero. Therefore, it is useful to give an
alternative definition of an ellipsoid using the expression \eqref{chap_ellcalc-ellsupp}.

\textbf{Definition.} Ellipsoid \({\mathcal E}(q,Q)\) in \({\bf R}^n\) with center
\(q\) and shape matrix \(Q\) is the set
\phantomsection\label{chap_ellcalc:equation-ellipsoid2}\begin{gather}
\begin{split}{\mathcal E}(q,Q) = \{ x \in {\bf R}^n ~|~
\langle l,x\rangle\leqslant\langle l,q\rangle + \langle l,Ql\rangle^{1/2}
\mbox{ for all } l\in{\bf R}^n \},\end{split}\label{chap_ellcalc-ellipsoid2}
\end{gather}
wherein matrix \(Q\) is positive semidefinite (\(Q=Q^T\) and
\(\langle x, Qx\rangle\geqslant0\) for all \(x\in{\bf R}^n\)).
The volume of ellipsoid \({\mathcal E}(q,Q)\) is
\phantomsection\label{chap_ellcalc:equation-ellvolume}\begin{gather}
\begin{split}{\bf Vol}(E(q,Q)) = {\bf Vol}_{\langle x,x\rangle\leqslant1}\sqrt{\det Q},\end{split}\label{chap_ellcalc-ellvolume}
\end{gather}
where \({\bf Vol}_{\langle x,x\rangle\leqslant1}\) is the volume of
the unit ball in \({\bf R}^n\):
\phantomsection\label{chap_ellcalc:equation-ellunitball}\begin{gather}
\begin{split}{\bf Vol}_{\langle x,x\rangle\leqslant1} = \left\{\begin{array}{ll}
\frac{\pi^{n/2}}{(n/2)!}, &
\mbox{ for even } n,\\
\frac{2^n\pi^{(n-1)/2}\left((n-1)/2\right)!}{n!}, &
\mbox{ for odd } n. \end{array}\right.\end{split}\label{chap_ellcalc-ellunitball}
\end{gather}
The distance from \({\mathcal E}(q,Q)\) to the fixed point \(a\)
is
\phantomsection\label{chap_ellcalc:equation-dist_point}\begin{gather}
\begin{split}{\bf dist}({\mathcal E}(q,Q),a) = \max_{\langle l,l\rangle=1}\left(\langle l,a\rangle -
\rho(l ~|~ {\mathcal E}(q,Q)) \right) =
\max_{\langle l,l\rangle=1}\left(\langle l,a\rangle - \langle l,q\rangle -
\langle l,Ql\rangle^{1/2}\right).\end{split}\label{chap_ellcalc-dist_point}
\end{gather}
If \({\bf dist}({\mathcal E}(q,Q),a) > 0\), \(a\) lies outside
\({\mathcal E}(q,Q)\); if
\({\bf dist}({\mathcal E}(q,Q),a) = 0\), \(a\) is a boundary
point of \({\mathcal E}(q,Q)\); if
\({\bf dist}({\mathcal E}(q,Q),a) < 0\), \(a\) is an internal
point of \({\mathcal E}(q,Q)\).

Given two ellipsoids, \({\mathcal E}(q_1,Q_1)\) and
\({\mathcal E}(q_2,Q_2)\), the distance between them is
\phantomsection\label{chap_ellcalc:equation-dist_ell}\begin{gather}
\begin{split}\begin{aligned}
{\bf dist}({\mathcal E}(q_1,Q_1),{\mathcal E}(q_2,Q_2)) & = \max_{\langle l,l\rangle=1}
\left(-\rho(-l ~|~ {\mathcal E}(q_1,Q_1)) - \rho(l ~|~ {\mathcal E}(q_2,Q_2))\right) \\
& = \max_{\langle l,l\rangle=1}\left(\langle l,q_1\rangle -
\langle l,Q_1l\rangle^{1/2} - \langle l,q_2\rangle -
\langle l,Q_2l\rangle^{1/2}\right).
\end{aligned}\end{split}\label{chap_ellcalc-dist_ell}
\end{gather}
If \({\bf dist}({\mathcal E}(q_1,Q_1),{\mathcal E}(q_2,Q_2)) > 0\),
the ellipsoids have no common points; if
\({\bf dist}({\mathcal E}(q_1,Q_1),{\mathcal E}(q_2,Q_2)) = 0\), the
ellipsoids have one common point - they touch; if
\({\bf dist}({\mathcal E}(q_1,Q_1),{\mathcal E}(q_2,Q_2)) < 0\), the
ellipsoids intersect.

Finding \({\bf dist}({\mathcal E}(q_1,Q_1),{\mathcal E}(q_2,Q_2))\)
using QCQP is
\begin{gather}
\begin{split}d({\mathcal E}(q_1,Q_1),{\mathcal E}(q_2,Q_2)) = \min \langle (x-y), (x-y)\rangle\end{split}\notag
\end{gather}
subject to:
\begin{gather}
\begin{split}\begin{aligned}
\langle (q_1-x), Q_1^{-1}(q_1-x)\rangle & \leqslant& 1,\\
\langle (q_2-x), Q_2^{-1}(q_2-y)\rangle & \leqslant& 1,\end{aligned}\end{split}\notag
\end{gather}
where
\begin{gather}
\begin{split}d({\mathcal E}(q_1,Q_1),{\mathcal E}(q_2,Q_2))=\left\{\begin{array}{ll}
{\bf dist}^2({\mathcal E}(q_1,Q_1),{\mathcal E}(q_2,Q_2)) &
\mbox{ if } {\bf dist}({\mathcal E}(q_1,Q_1),{\mathcal E}(q_2,Q_2))>0, \\
0 & \mbox{ otherwise}. \end{array}\right.\end{split}\notag
\end{gather}
Checking if \(k\) nondegenerate ellipsoids
\({\mathcal E}(q_1,Q_1),\cdots,{\mathcal E}(q_k,Q_k)\) have nonempty
intersection, can be cast as a quadratically constrained quadratic
programming (QCQP) problem:
\begin{gather}
\begin{split}\min 0\end{split}\notag
\end{gather}
subject to:
\begin{gather}
\begin{split}\langle (x-q_i),Q_i^{-1}(x-q_i)\rangle - 1 \leqslant0, ~~~ i=1,\cdots,k.\end{split}\notag
\end{gather}
If this problem is feasible, the intersection is nonempty.

\textbf{Definition.} Given compact convex set \({\mathcal X}\subseteq{\bf R}^n\), its polar
set, denoted \({\mathcal X}^\circ\), is
\begin{gather}
\begin{split}{\mathcal X}^\circ = \{x\in{\bf R}^n ~|~ \langle x,y\rangle\leqslant1, ~ y\in{\mathcal X}\},\end{split}\notag
\end{gather}
or, equivalently,
\begin{gather}
\begin{split}{\mathcal X}^\circ = \{l\in{\bf R}^n ~|~ \rho(l ~|~ {\mathcal X})\leqslant1\}.\end{split}\notag
\end{gather}
The properties of the polar set are
\begin{itemize}
\item {} 
If \({\mathcal X}\) contains the origin,
\(({\mathcal X}^\circ)^\circ = {\mathcal X}\);

\item {} 
If \({\mathcal X}_1\subseteq{\mathcal X}_2\),
\({\mathcal X}_2^\circ\subseteq{\mathcal X}_1^\circ\);

\item {} 
For any nonsingular matrix \(A\in{\bf R}^{n\times n}\),
\((A{\mathcal X})^\circ = (A^T)^{-1}{\mathcal X}^\circ\).

\end{itemize}

If a nondegenerate ellipsoid \({\mathcal E}(q,Q)\) contains the
origin, its polar set is also an ellipsoid:
\begin{gather}
\begin{split}\begin{aligned}
{\mathcal E}^\circ(q,Q) & = \{l\in{\bf R}^n ~|~ \langle l,q\rangle +
\langle l,Ql\rangle^{1/2}\leqslant1 \}\\
& = \{l\in{\bf R}^n ~|~ \langle l,(Q-qq^T)^{-1}l\rangle +
2\langle l,q\rangle\leqslant1 \}\\
& = \{l\in{\bf R}^n ~|~ \langle(l+(Q-qq^T)^{-1}q),
(Q-qq^T)(l+(Q-qq^T)^{-1}q)\rangle\leqslant1+\langle q,(Q-qq^T)^{-1}q\rangle \}.\end{aligned}\end{split}\notag
\end{gather}
The special case is
\begin{gather}
\begin{split}{\mathcal E}^\circ(0,Q) = {\mathcal E}(0,Q^{-1}).\end{split}\notag
\end{gather}
\textbf{Definition.} Given \(k\) compact sets
\({\mathcal X}_1, \cdots, {\mathcal X}_k\subseteq{\bf R}^n\), their
geometric (Minkowski) sum is
\phantomsection\label{chap_ellcalc:equation-minksum}\begin{gather}
\begin{split}{\mathcal X}_1\oplus\cdots\oplus{\mathcal X}_k=\bigcup_{x_1\in{\mathcal X}_1}\cdots\bigcup_{x_k\in{\mathcal X}_k}
\{x_1 + \cdots + x_k\} .\end{split}\label{chap_ellcalc-minksum}
\end{gather}
\textbf{Definition.} Given two compact sets
\({\mathcal X}_1, {\mathcal X}_2 \subseteq{\bf R}^n\), their
geometric (Minkowski) difference is
\phantomsection\label{chap_ellcalc:equation-minkdiff}\begin{gather}
\begin{split}{\mathcal X}_1\dot{-}{\mathcal X}_2 = \{x\in{\bf R}^n ~|~ x + {\mathcal X}_2 \subseteq {\mathcal X}_1 \}.\end{split}\label{chap_ellcalc-minkdiff}
\end{gather}
Ellipsoidal calculus concerns the following set of operations:
\begin{itemize}
\item {} 
affine transformation of ellipsoid;

\item {} 
geometric sum of finite number of ellipsoids;

\item {} 
geometric difference of two ellipsoids;

\item {} 
intersection of finite number of ellipsoids.

\end{itemize}

These operations occur in reachability calculation and verification of
piecewise affine dynamical systems. The result of all of these
operations, except for the affine transformation, is \emph{not} generally an
ellipsoid but some convex set, for which we can compute external and
internal ellipsoidal approximations.

Additional operations implemented in the \emph{Ellipsoidal Toolbox} include
external and internal approximations of intersections of ellipsoids with
hyperplanes, halfspaces and polytopes.

\textbf{Definition.} Hyperplane \(H(c,\gamma)\) in
\({\bf R}^n\) is the set
\phantomsection\label{chap_ellcalc:equation-hyperplane}\begin{gather}
\begin{split}H = \{x\in{\bf R}^n ~|~ \langle c, x\rangle = \gamma\}\end{split}\label{chap_ellcalc-hyperplane}
\end{gather}
with \(c\in{\bf R}^n\) and \(\gamma\in{\bf R}\) fixed.
The distance from ellipsoid \({\mathcal E}(q,Q)\) to
hyperplane \(H(c,\gamma)\) is
\phantomsection\label{chap_ellcalc:equation-dist_hp}\begin{gather}
\begin{split}{\bf dist}({\mathcal E}(q,Q),H(c,\gamma)) =
\frac{\left|\gamma-\langle c,q\rangle\right| -
\langle c,Qc\rangle^{1/2}}{\langle c,c\rangle^{1/2}}.\end{split}\label{chap_ellcalc-dist_hp}
\end{gather}
If \({\bf dist}({\mathcal E}(q,Q),H(c,\gamma))>0\), the ellipsoid
and the hyperplane do not intersect; if
\({\bf dist}({\mathcal E}(q,Q),H(c,\gamma))=0\), the hyperplane is a
supporting hyperplane for the ellipsoid; if
\({\bf dist}({\mathcal E}(q,Q),H(c,\gamma))<0\), the ellipsoid
intersects the hyperplane. The intersection of an ellipsoid with a
hyperplane is always an ellipsoid and can be computed directly.

Checking if the intersection of \(k\) nondegenerate ellipsoids
\(E(q_1,Q_1),\cdots,{\mathcal E}(q_k,Q_k)\) intersects hyperplane
\(H(c,\gamma)\), is equivalent to the feasibility check of the QCQP
problem:
\begin{gather}
\begin{split}\min 0\end{split}\notag
\end{gather}
subject to:
\begin{gather}
\begin{split}\begin{aligned}
\langle (x-q_i),Q_i^{-1}(x-q_i)\rangle - 1 \leqslant0, & & i=1,\cdots,k,\\
\langle c, x\rangle - \gamma = 0. & &\end{aligned}\end{split}\notag
\end{gather}
A hyperplane defines two (closed) \emph{halfspaces}:
\phantomsection\label{chap_ellcalc:equation-halfspace1}\begin{gather}
\begin{split}{\bf S}_1 = \{x\in{\bf R}^n ~|~ \langle c, x\rangle \leqslant\gamma\}\end{split}\label{chap_ellcalc-halfspace1}
\end{gather}
and
\phantomsection\label{chap_ellcalc:equation-halfspace2}\begin{gather}
\begin{split}{\bf S}_2 = \{x\in{\bf R}^n ~|~ \langle c, x\rangle \geqslant\gamma\}.\end{split}\label{chap_ellcalc-halfspace2}
\end{gather}
To avoid confusion, however, we shall further assume that a hyperplane
\(H(c,\gamma)\) specifies the halfspace in the sense \eqref{chap_ellcalc-halfspace1}.
In order to refer to the other halfspace, the same hyperplane should be
defined as \(H(-c,-\gamma)\).

The idea behind the calculation of intersection of an ellipsoid with a
halfspace is to treat the halfspace as an unbounded ellipsoid, that is,
as the ellipsoid with the shape matrix all but one of whose eigenvalues
are \(\infty\).

\textbf{Definition.} Polytope \(P(C,g)\) is the
intersection of a finite number of closed halfspaces:
\phantomsection\label{chap_ellcalc:equation-polytope}\begin{gather}
\begin{split}P = \{x\in{\bf R}^n ~|~ Cx\leqslant g\},\end{split}\label{chap_ellcalc-polytope}
\end{gather}
wherein \(C=[c_1 ~ \cdots ~ c_m]^T\in{\bf R}^{m\times n}\) and
\(g=[\gamma_1 ~ \cdots ~ \gamma_m]^T\in{\bf R}^m\).
The distance
from ellipsoid \({\mathcal E}(q,Q)\) to the polytope \(P(C,g)\)
is
\phantomsection\label{chap_ellcalc:equation-dist_poly}\begin{gather}
\begin{split}{\bf dist}({\mathcal E}(q,Q),P(C,g))=\min_{y\in P(C,g)}{\bf dist}({\mathcal E}(q,Q),y),\end{split}\label{chap_ellcalc-dist_poly}
\end{gather}
where \({\bf dist}({\mathcal E}(q,Q),y)\) comes from
({[}dist:sub:\emph{p}oint{]}). If
\({\bf dist}({\mathcal E}(q,Q),P(C,g))>0\), the ellipsoid and the
polytope do not intersect; if
\({\bf dist}({\mathcal E}(q,Q),P(C,g))=0\), the ellipsoid touches
the polytope; if \({\bf dist}({\mathcal E}(q,Q),P(C,g))<0\), the
ellipsoid intersects the polytope.

Checking if the intersection of \(k\) nondegenerate ellipsoids
\(E(q_1,Q_1),\cdots,{\mathcal E}(q_k,Q_k)\) intersects polytope
\(P(C,g)\) is equivalent to the feasibility check of the QCQP
problem:
\begin{gather}
\begin{split}\min 0\end{split}\notag
\end{gather}
subject to:
\begin{gather}
\begin{split}\begin{aligned}
\langle (x-q_i),Q_i^{-1}(x-q_i)\rangle - 1 \leqslant0, & & i=1,\cdots,k,\\
\langle c_j, x\rangle - \gamma_j \leqslant0, & & j=1,\cdots,m.\end{aligned}\end{split}\notag
\end{gather}

\section{Operations with Ellipsoids}
\label{chap_ellcalc:operations-with-ellipsoids}

\subsection{Affine Transformation}
\label{chap_ellcalc:affine-transformation}
The simplest operation with ellipsoids is an affine transformation. Let
ellipsoid \({\mathcal E}(q,Q)\subseteq{\bf R}^n\), matrix
\(A\in{\bf R}^{m\times n}\) and vector \(b\in{\bf R}^m\). Then
\phantomsection\label{chap_ellcalc:equation-affinetrans}\begin{gather}
\begin{split}A{\mathcal E}(q,Q) + b = {\mathcal E}(Aq+b, AQA^T) .\end{split}\label{chap_ellcalc-affinetrans}
\end{gather}
Thus, ellipsoids are preserved under affine transformation. If the rows
of \(A\) are linearly independent (which implies
\(m\leqslant n\)), and \(b=0\), the affine transformation is
called \emph{projection}.


\subsection{Geometric Sum}
\label{chap_ellcalc:geometric-sum}
Consider the geometric sum \eqref{chap_ellcalc-minksum} in which
\({\mathcal X}_1,\cdots\),\({\mathcal X}_k\) are nondegenerate
ellipsoids \({\mathcal E}(q_1,Q_1),\cdots\),
\({\mathcal E}(q_k,Q_k)\subseteq{\bf R}^n\). The resulting set is
not generally an ellipsoid. However, it can be tightly approximated by
the parametrized families of external and internal ellipsoids.

Let parameter \(l\) be some nonzero vector in \({\bf R}^n\).
Then the external approximation \({\mathcal E}(q,Q_l^+)\) and the
internal approximation \({\mathcal E}(q,Q_l^-)\) of the sum
\({\mathcal E}(q_1,Q_1)\oplus\cdots\oplus{\mathcal E}(q_k,Q_k)\) are
\emph{tight} along direction \(l\), i.e.,
\begin{gather}
\begin{split}{\mathcal E}(q,Q_l^-)\subseteq{\mathcal E}(q_1,Q_1)\oplus\cdots\oplus{\mathcal E}(q_k,Q_k)
\subseteq{\mathcal E}(q,Q_l^+)\end{split}\notag
\end{gather}
and
\begin{gather}
\begin{split}\rho(\pm l ~|~ {\mathcal E}(q,Q_l^-)) =
\rho(\pm l ~|~ {\mathcal E}(q_1,Q_1)\oplus\cdots\oplus{\mathcal E}(q_k,Q_k)) =
\rho(\pm l ~|~ {\mathcal E}(q,Q_l^+)).\end{split}\notag
\end{gather}
Here the center \(q\) is
\phantomsection\label{chap_ellcalc:equation-minksum_c}\begin{gather}
\begin{split}q = q_1 + \cdots + q_k ,\end{split}\label{chap_ellcalc-minksum_c}
\end{gather}
the shape matrix of the external ellipsoid \(Q_l^+\) is
\phantomsection\label{chap_ellcalc:equation-minksum_ea}\begin{gather}
\begin{split}Q_l^+ = \left(\langle l,Q_1l\rangle^{1/2} + \cdots
+ \langle l,Q_kl\rangle^{1/2}\right)
\left(\frac{1}{\langle l,Q_1l\rangle^{1/2}}Q_1 + \cdots +
\frac{1}{\langle l,Q_kl\rangle^{1/2}}Q_k\right),\end{split}\label{chap_ellcalc-minksum_ea}
\end{gather}
and the shape matrix of the internal ellipsoid \(Q_l^-\) is
\phantomsection\label{chap_ellcalc:equation-minksum_ia}\begin{gather}
\begin{split}Q_l^- = \left(Q_1^{1/2} + S_2Q_2^{1/2} + \cdots + S_kQ_k^{1/2}\right)^T
\left(Q_1^{1/2} + S_2Q_2^{1/2} + \cdots + S_kQ_k^{1/2}\right),\end{split}\label{chap_ellcalc-minksum_ia}
\end{gather}
with matrices \(S_i\), \(i=2,\cdots,k\), being orthogonal
(\(S_iS_i^T=I\)) and such that vectors
\(Q_1^{1/2}l, S_2Q_2^{1/2}l, \cdots, S_kQ_k^{1/2}l\) are parallel.

Varying vector \(l\) we get exact external and internal
approximations,
\begin{gather}
\begin{split}\bigcup_{\langle l,l\rangle=1} {\mathcal E}(q,Q_l^-) =
{\mathcal E}(q_1,Q_1)\oplus\cdots\oplus{\mathcal E}(q_k,Q_k) =
\bigcap_{\langle l,l\rangle=1} {\mathcal E}(q,Q_l^+) .\end{split}\notag
\end{gather}
For proofs of formulas given in this section, see {\hyperref[chap_intro:kur1997]{{[}KUR1997{]}}}, {\hyperref[chap_intro:kur2000]{{[}KUR2000{]}}}.

One last comment is about how to find orthogonal matrices
\(S_2,\cdots,S_k\) that align vectors
\(Q_2^{1/2}l, \cdots, Q_k^{1/2}l\) with \(Q_1^{1/2}l\). Let
\(v_1\) and \(v_2\) be some unit vectors in \({\bf R}^n\).
We have to find matrix \(S\) such that
\(Sv_2\uparrow\uparrow v_1\).
We suggest explicit formulas for the
calculation of this matrix {\hyperref[chap_ellcalc:dar2012]{{[}DAR2012{]}}}:
\phantomsection\label{chap_ellcalc:equation-valign1}\begin{gather}
\begin{split}T = I + Q_1(S - I)Q_1^T,\end{split}\label{chap_ellcalc-valign1}
\end{gather}\phantomsection\label{chap_ellcalc:equation-valign2}\begin{gather}
\begin{split}S = \begin{pmatrix}
     c & s\\
     -s & c
    \end{pmatrix},\quad c = \langle\hat{v_1},\ \hat{v_2}\rangle,\ \quad s = \sqrt{1 - c^2},\ \quad \hat{v_i} = \dfrac{v_i}{\|v_i\|}\end{split}\label{chap_ellcalc-valign2}
\end{gather}\phantomsection\label{chap_ellcalc:equation-valign3}\begin{gather}
\begin{split}Q_1 = [q_1 \, q_2]\in \mathbb{R}^{n\times2},\ \quad q_1 = \hat{v_1},\ \quad q_2 = \begin{cases}
s^{-1}(\hat{v_2} - c\hat{v_1}),& s\ne 0\\
0,& s = 0.
\end{cases}\end{split}\label{chap_ellcalc-valign3}
\end{gather}

\subsection{Geometric Difference}
\label{chap_ellcalc:geometric-difference}
Consider the geometric difference \eqref{chap_ellcalc-minkdiff} in which the sets
\({\mathcal X}_1\) and \({\mathcal X}_2\) are nondegenerate
ellipsoids \({\mathcal E}(q_1,Q_1)\) and
\({\mathcal E}(q_2,Q_2)\). We say that ellipsoid
\({\mathcal E}(q_1,Q_1)\) is \emph{bigger} than ellipsoid
\({\mathcal E}(q_2,Q_2)\) if
\begin{gather}
\begin{split}{\mathcal E}(0,Q_2) \subseteq {\mathcal E}(0,Q_1).\end{split}\notag
\end{gather}
If this condition is not fulfilled, the geometric difference
\({\mathcal E}(q_1,Q_1)\dot{-}{\mathcal E}(q_2,Q_2)\) is an empty
set:
\begin{gather}
\begin{split}{\mathcal E}(0,Q_2) \not\subseteq {\mathcal E}(0,Q_1) ~~~ \Rightarrow ~~~
{\mathcal E}(q_1,Q_1) \dot{-}{\mathcal E}(q_2,Q_2) = \emptyset.\end{split}\notag
\end{gather}
If \({\mathcal E}(q_1,Q_1)\) is bigger than
\({\mathcal E}(q_2,Q_2)\) and \({\mathcal E}(q_2,Q_2)\) is
bigger than \({\mathcal E}(q_1,Q_1)\), in other words, if
\(Q_1=Q_2\),
\begin{gather}
\begin{split}{\mathcal E}(q_1,Q_1) \dot{-}{\mathcal E}(q_2,Q_2) = \{q_1-q_2\} ~~~ \mbox{and} ~~~
{\mathcal E}(q_2,Q_2) \dot{-}{\mathcal E}(q_1,Q_1) = \{q_2-q_1\}.\end{split}\notag
\end{gather}
To check if ellipsoid \({\mathcal E}(q_1,Q_1)\) is bigger than
ellipsoid \({\mathcal E}(q_2,Q_2)\), we perform simultaneous
diagonalization of matrices \(Q_1\) and \(Q_2\), that is, we
find matrix \(T\) such that
\begin{gather}
\begin{split}TQ_1T^T = I ~~~ \mbox{and} ~~~ TQ_2T^T=D,\end{split}\notag
\end{gather}
where \(D\) is some diagonal matrix. Simultaneous diagonalization
of \(Q_1\) and \(Q_2\) is possible because both are symmetric
positive definite (see {\hyperref[chap_ellcalc:gant1960]{{[}GANT1960{]}}}). To find such matrix
\(T\), we first do the SVD of \(Q_1\):
\phantomsection\label{chap_ellcalc:equation-simdiag1}\begin{gather}
\begin{split}Q_1 = U_1\Sigma_1V_1^T .\end{split}\label{chap_ellcalc-simdiag1}
\end{gather}
Then the SVD of matrix
\(\Sigma_1^{-1/2}U_1^TQ_2U_1\Sigma_1^{-1/2}\):
\phantomsection\label{chap_ellcalc:equation-simdiag2}\begin{gather}
\begin{split}\Sigma_1^{-1/2}U_1^TQ_2U_1\Sigma_1^{-1/2} = U_2\Sigma_2V_2^T.\end{split}\label{chap_ellcalc-simdiag2}
\end{gather}
Now, \(T\) is defined as
\phantomsection\label{chap_ellcalc:equation-simdiag3}\begin{gather}
\begin{split}T = U_2^T \Sigma_1^{-1/2}U_1^T.\end{split}\label{chap_ellcalc-simdiag3}
\end{gather}
If the biggest diagonal element (eigenvalue) of matrix \(D=TQ_2T^T\)
is less than or equal to \(1\),
\({\mathcal E}(0,Q_2)\subseteq{\mathcal E}(0,Q_1)\).

Once it is established that ellipsoid \({\mathcal E}(q_1,Q_1)\) is
bigger than ellipsoid \({\mathcal E}(q_2,Q_2)\), we know that their
geometric difference
\({\mathcal E}(q_1,Q_1)\dot{-}{\mathcal E}(q_2,Q_2)\) is a nonempty
convex compact set. Although it is not generally an ellipsoid, we can
find tight external and internal approximations of this set parametrized
by vector \(l\in{\bf R}^n\). Unlike geometric sum, however,
ellipsoidal approximations for the geometric difference do not exist for
every direction \(l\). Vectors for which the approximations do not
exist are called \emph{bad directions}.

Given two ellipsoids \({\mathcal E}(q_1,Q_1)\) and
\({\mathcal E}(q_2,Q_2)\) with
\({\mathcal E}(0,Q_2)\subseteq{\mathcal E}(0,Q_1)\), \(l\) is a
bad direction if
\begin{gather}
\begin{split}\frac{\langle l,Q_1l\rangle^{1/2}}{\langle l,Q_2l\rangle^{1/2}}>r,\end{split}\notag
\end{gather}
in which \(r\) is a minimal root of the equation
\begin{gather}
\begin{split}{\bf det}(Q_1-rQ_2) = 0.\end{split}\notag
\end{gather}
To find \(r\), compute matrix \(T\) by \eqref{chap_ellcalc-simdiag1}-\eqref{chap_ellcalc-simdiag3}
and define
\begin{gather}
\begin{split}r = \frac{1}{\max({\bf diag}(TQ_2T^T))}.\end{split}\notag
\end{gather}
If \(l\) is \emph{not} a bad direction, we can find tight external and
internal ellipsoidal approximations \({\mathcal E}(q,Q^+_l)\) and
\({\mathcal E}(q,Q^-_l)\) such that
\begin{gather}
\begin{split}{\mathcal E}(q,Q^-_l)\subseteq{\mathcal E}(q_1,Q_1)\dot{-}{\mathcal E}(q_2,Q_2)\subseteq{\mathcal E}(q,Q^+_l)\end{split}\notag
\end{gather}

\begin{gather}
\begin{split}\rho(\pm l ~|~ {\mathcal E}(q,Q_l^-)) =
\rho(\pm l ~|~ {\mathcal E}(q_1,Q_1)\dot{-}{\mathcal E}(q_2,Q_2)) =
\rho(\pm l ~|~ {\mathcal E}(q,Q_l^+)).\end{split}\notag
\end{gather}
The center \(q\) is
\phantomsection\label{chap_ellcalc:equation-minkdiff_c}\begin{gather}
\begin{split}q = q_1 - q_2;\end{split}\label{chap_ellcalc-minkdiff_c}
\end{gather}
the shape matrix of the internal ellipsoid \(Q^-_l\) is
\begin{gather}
\begin{split}\begin{aligned}
&& P = \frac{\sqrt{\langle l, Q_1 l\rangle}}{\sqrt{\langle l, Q_2 \rangle}};\nonumber\\
&& Q^-_l = \left(1 - \dfrac{1}{P}\right)Q_1 + \left(1 - P\right)Q_2.
\label{minkdiff_ia}\end{aligned}\end{split}\notag

and the shape matrix of the external ellipsoid \(Q^+_l\) is
\phantomsection\label{chap_ellcalc:equation-minkdiff_ea}\begin{gather}
\begin{split}Q^+_l = \left(Q_1^{1/2} - SQ_2^{1/2}\right)^T
\left(Q_1^{1/2} - SQ_2^{1/2}\right).\end{split}\label{chap_ellcalc-minkdiff_ea}
\end{gather}
Here \(S\) is an orthogonal matrix such that vectors
\(Q_1^{1/2}l\) and \(SQ_2^{1/2}l\) are parallel. \(S\) is
found from \eqref{chap_ellcalc-valign1}-\eqref{chap_ellcalc-valign3}, with \(v_1=Q_2^{1/2}l\) and
\(v_2=Q_1^{1/2}l\).

Running \(l\) over all unit directions that are not bad, we get
\begin{gather}
\begin{split}\bigcup_{\langle l,l\rangle=1} {\mathcal E}(q,Q_l^-) =
{\mathcal E}(q_1,Q_1)\dot{-}{\mathcal E}(q_2,Q_2) =

\subsection{Geometric Difference-Sum}
\label{chap_ellcalc:diff-sum-label}\label{chap_ellcalc:geometric-difference-sum}
Given ellipsoids \({\mathcal E}(q_1,Q_1)\),
\({\mathcal E}(q_2,Q_2)\) and \({\mathcal E}(q_3,Q_3)\), it is
possible to compute families of external and internal approximating
ellipsoids for
\phantomsection\label{chap_ellcalc:equation-minkmp}\begin{gather}
\begin{split}{\mathcal E}(q_1,Q_1) \dot{-} {\mathcal E}(q_2,Q_2) \oplus {\mathcal E}(q_3,Q_3)\end{split}\label{chap_ellcalc-minkmp}
\end{gather}
parametrized by direction \(l\), if this set is nonempty
(\({\mathcal E}(0,Q_2)\subseteq{\mathcal E}(0,Q_1)\)).

First, using the result of the previous section, for any direction
\(l\) that is not bad, we obtain tight external
\({\mathcal E}(q_1-q_2, Q_l^{0+})\) and internal
\({\mathcal E}(q_1-q_2, Q_l^{0-})\) approximations of the set
\({\mathcal E}(q_1,Q_1)\dot{-}{\mathcal E}(q_2,Q_2)\).

The second and last step is, using the result of section 2.2.2, to find
tight external ellipsoidal approximation
\({\mathcal E}(q_1-q_2+q_3,Q_l^+)\) of the sum
\({\mathcal E}(q_1-q_2,Q_l^{0+})\oplus{\mathcal E}(q_3,Q_3)\), and
tight internal ellipsoidal approximation
\({\mathcal E}(q_1-q_2+q_3,Q_l^-)\) for the sum
\({\mathcal E}(q_1-q_2,Q_l^{0-})\oplus{\mathcal E}(q_3,Q_3)\).

As a result, we get
\begin{gather}
\begin{split}{\mathcal E}(q_1-q_2+q_3,Q_l^-) \subseteq
{\mathcal E}(q_1,Q_1)\dot{-}{\mathcal E}(q_2,Q_2)\oplus{\mathcal E}(q_3,Q_3) \subseteq
{\mathcal E}(q_1-q_2+q_3,Q_l^+)\end{split}\notag
\end{gather}
and
\begin{gather}
\begin{split}\rho(\pm l ~|~{\mathcal E}(q_1-q_2+q_3,Q_l^-)) =
\rho(\pm l ~|~ {\mathcal E}(q_1,Q_1)\dot{-}{\mathcal E}(q_2,Q_2)\oplus{\mathcal E}(q_3,Q_3)) =
\rho(\pm l ~|~ {\mathcal E}(q_1-q_2+q_3,Q_l^+)).\end{split}\notag
\end{gather}
Running \(l\) over all unit vectors that are not bad, this
translates to
\begin{gather}
\begin{split}\bigcup_{\langle l,l\rangle=1} {\mathcal E}(q_1-q_2+q_3,Q_l^-) =
{\mathcal E}(q_1,Q_1)\dot{-}{\mathcal E}(q_2,Q_2)\oplus{\mathcal E}(q_3,Q_3) =
\bigcap_{\langle l,l\rangle=1} {\mathcal E}(q_1-q_2+q_3,Q_l^+) .\end{split}\notag
\end{gather}

\subsection{Geometric Sum-Difference}
\label{chap_ellcalc:sum-diff-label}\label{chap_ellcalc:geometric-sum-difference}
Given ellipsoids \({\mathcal E}(q_1,Q1)\),
\({\mathcal E}(q_2,Q_2)\) and \({\mathcal E}(q_3,Q_3)\), it is
possible to compute families of external and internal approximating
ellipsoids for
\phantomsection\label{chap_ellcalc:equation-minkpm}\begin{gather}
\begin{split}{\mathcal E}(q_1,Q_1) \oplus {\mathcal E}(q_2,Q_2) \dot{-} {\mathcal E}(q_3,Q_3)\end{split}\label{chap_ellcalc-minkpm}
\end{gather}
parametrized by direction \(l\), if this set is nonempty
(\({\mathcal E}(0,Q_3)\subseteq{\mathcal E}(0,Q_1)\oplus{\mathcal E}(0,Q_2)\)).

First, using the result of section 2.2.2, we obtain tight external
\({\mathcal E}(q_1+q_2,Q_l^{0+})\) and internal
\({\mathcal E}(q_1+q_2,Q_l^{0-})\) ellipsoidal approximations of the
set \({\mathcal E}(q_1,Q_1)\oplus{\mathcal E}(q_2,Q_2)\). In order
for the set \eqref{chap_ellcalc-minkpm} to be nonempty, inclusion
\({\mathcal E}(0,Q_3)\subseteq{\mathcal E}(0,Q_l^{0+})\) must be
true for any \(l\). Note, however, that even if \eqref{chap_ellcalc-minkpm} is
nonempty, it may be that
\({\mathcal E}(0,Q_3)\not\subseteq{\mathcal E}(0,Q_l^{0-})\), then
internal approximation for this direction does not exist.

Assuming that \eqref{chap_ellcalc-minkpm} is nonempty and
\({\mathcal E}(0,Q_3)\subseteq{\mathcal E}(0,Q_l^{0-})\), the second
step would be, using the results of section 2.2.3, to compute tight
external ellipsoidal approximation
\({\mathcal E}(q_1+q_2-q_3,Q_l^+)\) of the difference
\({\mathcal E}(q_1+q_2,Q_l^{0+})\dot{-}{\mathcal E}(q_3,Q_3)\),
which exists only if \(l\) is not bad, and tight internal
ellipsoidal approximation \({\mathcal E}(q_1+q_2-q_3,Q_l^-)\) of the
difference
\({\mathcal E}(q_1+q_2,Q_l^{0-})\dot{-}{\mathcal E}(q_3,Q_3)\),
which exists only if \(l\) is not bad for this difference.

If approximation \({\mathcal E}(q_1+q_2-q_3,Q_l^+)\) exists, then
\begin{gather}
\begin{split}{\mathcal E}(q_1,Q_1)\oplus{\mathcal E}(q_2,Q_2)\dot{-}{\mathcal E}(q_3,Q_3) \subseteq
{\mathcal E}(q_1+q_2-q_3,Q_l^+)\end{split}\notag
\end{gather}
and
\begin{gather}
\begin{split}\rho(\pm l ~|~ {\mathcal E}(q_1,Q_1)\oplus{\mathcal E}(q_2,Q_2)\dot{-}{\mathcal E}(q_3,Q_3)) =
\rho(\pm l ~|~ {\mathcal E}(q_1+q_2-q_3,Q_l^+)).\end{split}\notag
\end{gather}
If approximation \({\mathcal E}(q_1+q_2-q_3,Q_l^-)\) exists, then
\begin{gather}
\begin{split}{\mathcal E}(q_1+q_2-q_3,Q_l^-) \subseteq
{\mathcal E}(q_1,Q_1)\oplus{\mathcal E}(q_2,Q_2)\dot{-}{\mathcal E}(q_3,Q_3)\end{split}\notag
\end{gather}
and
\begin{gather}
\begin{split}\rho(\pm l ~|~{\mathcal E}(q_1+q_2-q_3,Q_l^-)) =
\rho(\pm l ~|~ {\mathcal E}(q_1,Q_1)\oplus{\mathcal E}(q_2,Q_2)\dot{-}{\mathcal E}(q_3,Q_3)) .\end{split}\notag
\end{gather}
For any fixed direction \(l\) it may be the case that neither
external nor internal tight ellipsoidal approximations exist.


\subsection{Intersection of Ellipsoid and Hyperplane}
\label{chap_ellcalc:intersection-of-ellipsoid-and-hyperplane}
Let nondegenerate ellipsoid \({\mathcal E}(q,Q)\) and hyperplane
\(H(c,\gamma)\) be such that
\({\bf dist}({\mathcal E}(q,Q),H(c,\gamma))<0\). In other words,
\begin{gather}
\begin{split}{\mathcal E}_H(w,W) = {\mathcal E}(q,Q)\cap H(c,\gamma) \neq \emptyset .\end{split}\notag
\end{gather}
The intersection of ellipsoid with hyperplane, if nonempty, is always
an ellipsoid. Here we show how to find it.

First of all, we transform the hyperplane \(H(c,\gamma)\) into
\(H([1~0~\cdots~0]^T, 0)\) by the affine transformation
\begin{gather}
\begin{split}y = Sx - \frac{\gamma}{\langle c,c\rangle^{1/2}}Sc,\end{split}\notag
\end{gather}
where \(S\) is an orthogonal matrix found by \eqref{chap_ellcalc-valign1}-\eqref{chap_ellcalc-valign3}
with \(v_1=c\) and \(v_2=[1~0~\cdots~0]^T\). The ellipsoid in
the new coordinates becomes \({\mathcal E}(q',Q')\) with
\begin{gather}
\begin{split}\begin{aligned}
q' & = q-\frac{\gamma}{\langle c,c\rangle^{1/2}}Sc, \\
Q' & = SQS^T.\end{aligned}\end{split}\notag
\end{gather}
Define matrix \(M=Q'^{-1}\); \(m_{11}\) is its element in
position \((1,1)\), \(\bar{m}\) is the first column of \(M\)
without the first element, and \(\bar{M}\) is the submatrix of
\(M\) obtained by stripping \(M\) of its first row and first
column:
\begin{gather}
\begin{split}M = \left[\begin{array}{c|cl}
m_{11} & & \bar{m}^T\\
 & \\
\hline
 & \\
\bar{m} & & \bar{M}\end{array}\right].\end{split}\notag
\end{gather}
The ellipsoid resulting from the intersection is
\({\mathcal E}_H(w',W')\) with
\begin{gather}
\begin{split}\begin{aligned}
w' & = q' + q_1'\left[\begin{array}{c}
-1\\
\bar{M}^{-1}\bar{m}\end{array}\right],\\
W' & = \left(1-q_1'^2(m_{11}-
\langle\bar{m},\bar{M}^{-1}\bar{m}\rangle)\right)\left[\begin{array}{c|cl}
0 & & {\bf 0}\\
 & \\
\hline
 & \\
{\bf 0} & & \bar{M}^{-1}\end{array}\right],\end{aligned}\end{split}\notag
\end{gather}
in which \(q_1'\) represents the first element of vector \(q'\).

Finally, it remains to do the inverse transform of the coordinates to
obtain ellipsoid \({\mathcal E}_H(w,W)\):
\begin{gather}
\begin{split}\begin{aligned}
w & = S^Tw' + \frac{\gamma}{\langle c,c\rangle^{1/2}}c, \\
W & = S^TW'S.\end{aligned}\end{split}\notag
\end{gather}

\subsection{Intersection of Ellipsoid and Ellipsoid}
\label{chap_ellcalc:intersection-of-ellipsoid-and-ellipsoid}
Given two nondegenerate ellipsoids \({\mathcal E}(q_1,Q_1)\) and
\({\mathcal E}(q_2,Q_2)\),
\({\bf dist}({\mathcal E}(q_1,Q_1),{\mathcal E}(q_2,Q_2))<0\)
implies that
\begin{gather}
\begin{split}{\mathcal E}(q_1,Q_1)\cap{\mathcal E}(q_2,Q_2)\neq\emptyset .\end{split}\notag
\end{gather}
This intersection can be approximated by ellipsoids from the outside
and from the inside. Trivially, both \({\mathcal E}(q_1,Q_1)\) and
\({\mathcal E}(q_2,Q_2)\) are external approximations of this
intersection. Here, however, we show how to find the external
ellipsoidal approximation of minimal volume.

Define matrices
\begin{gather}
\begin{split}W_1 = Q_1^{-1}, ~~~~ W_2 = Q_2^{-1} .\label{wmatrices}\end{split}\notag
\end{gather}
Minimal volume external ellipsoidal approximation
\({\mathcal E}(q+,Q^+)\) of the intersection
\({\mathcal E}(q_1,Q_1)\cap{\mathcal E}(q_2,Q_2)\) is determined
from the set of equations:
\phantomsection\label{chap_ellcalc:equation-fusion1}\begin{gather}
\begin{split}Q^+  = \alpha X^{-1}, \\\end{split}\label{chap_ellcalc-fusion1}
\end{gather}\phantomsection\label{chap_ellcalc:equation-fusion2}\begin{gather}
\begin{split}X  =  \pi W_1 + (1-\pi)W_2,\\\end{split}\label{chap_ellcalc-fusion2}
\end{gather}\phantomsection\label{chap_ellcalc:equation-fusion3}\begin{gather}
\begin{split}\alpha  =  1-\pi(1-\pi)\langle(q_2-q_1), W_2X^{-1}W_1(q_2-q_1)\rangle, \\\end{split}\label{chap_ellcalc-fusion3}
\end{gather}\phantomsection\label{chap_ellcalc:equation-fusion4}\begin{gather}
\begin{split}q^+  = X^{-1}(\pi W_1q_1 + (1-\pi)W_2q_2), \\\end{split}\label{chap_ellcalc-fusion4}
\end{gather}\phantomsection\label{chap_ellcalc:equation-fusion5}\begin{gather}
\begin{split}0 &=  \alpha({\bf det}(X))^2{\bf trace}(X^{-1}(W_1-W_2)) - {}\\
  &- n({\bf det}(X))^2 (2\langle q^+,W_1q_1-W_2q_2\rangle + \langle q^+,(W_2-W_1)q^+\rangle - {}\\
  &- \langle q_1,W_1q_1\rangle + \langle q_2,W_2q_2\rangle),\end{split}\label{chap_ellcalc-fusion5}
\end{gather}
with \(0\leqslant\pi\leqslant1\). We substitute \(X\),
\(\alpha\), \(q^+\) defined in \eqref{chap_ellcalc-fusion2}-\eqref{chap_ellcalc-fusion4} into
\eqref{chap_ellcalc-fusion5} and get a polynomial of degree \(2n-1\) with respect to
\(\pi\), which has only one root in the interval \([0,1]\),
\(\pi_0\). Then, substituting \(\pi=\pi_0\) into
\eqref{chap_ellcalc-fusion1}-\eqref{chap_ellcalc-fusion4}, we obtain \(q^+\) and \(Q^+\). Special
cases are \(\pi_0=1\), whence
\({\mathcal E}(q^+,Q^+)={\mathcal E}(q_1,Q_1)\), and
\(\pi_0=0\), whence
\({\mathcal E}(q^+,Q^+)={\mathcal E}(q_2,Q_2)\). These situations
may occur if, for example, one ellipsoid is contained in the other:
\begin{gather}
\begin{split}{\mathcal E}(q_1,Q_1)\subseteq{\mathcal E}(q_2,Q_2) & \Rightarrow \pi_0 = 1,\\
{\mathcal E}(q_2,Q_2)\subseteq{\mathcal E}(q_1,Q_1) & \Rightarrow \pi_0 = 0.\end{split}\notag
\end{gather}
The proof that the system of equations \eqref{chap_ellcalc-fusion1}-\eqref{chap_ellcalc-fusion5} correctly
defines the minimal volume external ellipsoidal approximationi of the
intersection \({\mathcal E}(q_1,Q_1)\cap{\mathcal E}(q_2,Q_2)\) is
given in {\hyperref[chap_ellcalc:ros2002]{{[}ROS2002{]}}}.

To find the internal approximating ellipsoid
\({\mathcal E}(q^-,Q^-)\subseteq{\mathcal E}(q_1,Q_1)\cap{\mathcal E}(q_2,Q_2)\),
define
\phantomsection\label{chap_ellcalc:equation-beta1}\begin{gather}
\begin{split}\beta_1 = \min_{\langle x,W_2x\rangle=1}\langle x,W_1x\rangle,\end{split}\label{chap_ellcalc-beta1}
\end{gather}\phantomsection\label{chap_ellcalc:equation-beta2}\begin{gather}
\begin{split}\beta_2 = \min_{\langle x,W_1x\rangle=1}\langle x,W_2x\rangle,\end{split}\label{chap_ellcalc-beta2}
\end{gather}
Notice that \eqref{chap_ellcalc-beta1} and \eqref{chap_ellcalc-beta2} are QCQP problems. Parameters
\(\beta_1\) and \(\beta_2\) are invariant with respect to affine
coordinate transformation and describe the position of ellipsoids
\({\mathcal E}(q_1,Q_1)\), \({\mathcal E}(q_2,Q_2)\) with
respect to each other:
\begin{gather}
\begin{split}\beta_1\geqslant1,~\beta_2\geqslant1 & \Rightarrow
{\bf int}({\mathcal E}(q_1,Q_1)\cap{\mathcal E}(q_2,Q_2))=\emptyset, \\\end{split}\notag\\\begin{split}\beta_1\geqslant1,~\beta_2\leqslant1 & \Rightarrow {\mathcal E}(q_1,Q_1)\subseteq{\mathcal E}(q_2,Q_2), \\\end{split}\notag\\\begin{split}\beta_1\leqslant1,~\beta_2\geqslant1 & \Rightarrow {\mathcal E}(q_2,Q_2)\subseteq{\mathcal E}(q_1,Q_1), \\\end{split}\notag\\\begin{split}\beta_1<1,~\beta_2<1 & \Rightarrow
{\bf int}({\mathcal E}(q_1,Q_1)\cap{\mathcal E}(q_2,Q_2))\neq\emptyset \\\end{split}\notag\\\begin{split}&\mbox{and} ~ {\mathcal E}(q_1,Q_1)\not\subseteq{\mathcal E}(q_2,Q_2) \\\end{split}\notag\\\begin{split}&\mbox{and} ~ {\mathcal E}(q_2,Q_2)\not\subseteq{\mathcal E}(q_1,Q_1).\end{split}\notag
\end{gather}
Define parametrized family of internal ellipsoids
\({\mathcal E}(q^-_{\theta_1\theta_2},Q^-_{\theta_1\theta_2})\) with
\phantomsection\label{chap_ellcalc:equation-paramell1}\begin{gather}
\begin{split}q^-_{\theta_1\theta_2}  =  (\theta_1W_1 +
\theta_2W_2)^{-1}(\theta_1W_1q_1 + \theta_2W_2q_2),\\\end{split}\label{chap_ellcalc-paramell1}
\end{gather}\phantomsection\label{chap_ellcalc:equation-paramell2}\begin{gather}
\begin{split}Q^-_{\theta_1\theta_2} =  (1 - \theta_1\langle q_1,W_1q_1\rangle -
\theta_2\langle q_2,W_2q_2\rangle +
\langle q^-_{\theta_1\theta_2},(Q^-)^{-1}q^-_{\theta_1\theta_2}\rangle)
(\theta_1W_1 + \theta_2W_2)^{-1} .\end{split}\label{chap_ellcalc-paramell2}
\end{gather}
The best internal ellipsoid
\({\mathcal E}(q^-_{\hat{\theta}_1\hat{\theta}_2},Q^-_{\hat{\theta}_1\hat{\theta}_2})\)
in the class \eqref{chap_ellcalc-paramell1}-\eqref{chap_ellcalc-paramell2}, namely, such that
\begin{gather}
\begin{split}{\mathcal E}(q^-_{{\theta}_1{\theta}_2},Q^-_{{\theta}_1{\theta}_2})\subseteq
{\mathcal E}(q^-_{\hat{\theta}_1\hat{\theta}_2},Q^-_{\hat{\theta}_1\hat{\theta}_2})
\subseteq {\mathcal E}(q_1,Q_1)\cap{\mathcal E}(q_2,Q_2)\end{split}\notag
\end{gather}
for all \(0\leqslant\theta_1,\theta_2\leqslant1\), is specified by
the parameters
\phantomsection\label{chap_ellcalc:equation-thetapar}\begin{gather}
\begin{split}\hat{\theta}_1 = \frac{1-\hat{\beta}_2}{1-\hat{\beta}_1\hat{\beta}_2}, ~~~~
\hat{\theta}_2 = \frac{1-\hat{\beta}_1}{1-\hat{\beta}_1\hat{\beta}_2},\end{split}\label{chap_ellcalc-thetapar}
\end{gather}
with
\begin{gather}
\begin{split}\hat{\beta}_1=\min(1,\beta_1), ~~~~ \hat{\beta}_2=\min(1,\beta_2).\end{split}\notag
\end{gather}
It is the ellipsoid that we look for:
\({\mathcal E}(q^-,Q^-)={\mathcal E}(q^-_{\hat{\theta}_1\hat{\theta}_2},Q^-_{\hat{\theta}_1\hat{\theta}_2})\).
Two special cases are
\begin{gather}
\begin{split}\hat{\theta}_1=1, ~ \hat{\theta}_2=0 ~~~ \Rightarrow ~~~
{\mathcal E}(q_1,Q_1)\subseteq{\mathcal E}(q_2,Q_2) ~~~ \Rightarrow ~~~
{\mathcal E}(q^-,Q^-)={\mathcal E}(q_1,Q_1),\end{split}\notag
\end{gather}
and
\begin{gather}
\begin{split}\hat{\theta}_1=0, ~ \hat{\theta}_2=1 ~~~ \Rightarrow ~~~
{\mathcal E}(q_2,Q_2)\subseteq{\mathcal E}(q_1,Q_1) ~~~ \Rightarrow ~~~
{\mathcal E}(q^-,Q^-)={\mathcal E}(q_2,Q_2).\end{split}\notag
\end{gather}
The method of finding the internal ellipsoidal approximation of the
intersection of two ellipsoids is described in {\hyperref[chap_ellcalc:vaz1999]{{[}VAZ1999{]}}}.


\subsection{Intersection of Ellipsoid and Halfspace}
\label{chap_ellcalc:intersection-of-ellipsoid-and-halfspace}
Finding the intersection of ellipsoid and halfspace can be reduced to
finding the intersection of two ellipsoids, one of which is unbounded.
Let \({\mathcal E}(q_1,Q_1)\) be a nondegenerate ellipsoid and let
\(H(c,\gamma)\) define the halfspace
\begin{gather}
\begin{split}{\bf S}(c,\gamma) = \{x\in{\bf R}^n ~|~ \langle c,x\rangle\leqslant\gamma\}.\end{split}\notag
\end{gather}
We have to determine if the intersection
\({\mathcal E}(q_1,Q_1)\cap{\bf S}(c,\gamma)\) is empty, and if not,
find its external and internal ellipsoidal approximations,
\({\mathcal E}(q^+,Q^+)\) and \({\mathcal E}(q^-,Q^-)\). Two
trivial situations are:
\begin{itemize}
\item {} 
\({\bf dist}({\mathcal E}(q_1,Q_1),H(c,\gamma))>0\) and
\(\langle c, q_1\rangle>0\), which implies that
\({\mathcal E}(q_1,Q_1)\cap{\bf S}(c,\gamma)=\emptyset\);

\item {} 
\({\bf dist}({\mathcal E}(q_1,Q_1),H(c,\gamma))>0\) and
\(\langle c, q_1\rangle<0\), so that
\({\mathcal E}(q_1,Q_1)\subseteq{\bf S}(c,\gamma)\), and then
\({\mathcal E}(q^+,Q^+)={\mathcal E}(q^-,Q^-)={\mathcal E}(q_1,Q_1)\).

\end{itemize}

In case \({\bf dist}({\mathcal E}(q_1,Q_1),H(c,\gamma)<0\), i.e. the
ellipsoid intersects the hyperplane,
\begin{gather}
\begin{split}{\mathcal E}(q_1,Q_1)\cap{\bf S}(c,\gamma) =
{\mathcal E}(q_1,Q_1)\cap\{x ~|~ \langle (x-q_2),W_2(x-q_2)\rangle\leqslant1\},\end{split}\notag
\end{gather}
with
\phantomsection\label{chap_ellcalc:equation-hsell1}\begin{gather}
\begin{split}q_2  =  (\gamma + 2\sqrt{\overline{\lambda}})c,\\\end{split}\label{chap_ellcalc-hsell1}
\end{gather}\phantomsection\label{chap_ellcalc:equation-hsell2}\begin{gather}
\begin{split}W_2  =  \frac{1}{4\overline{\lambda}}cc^T,\end{split}\label{chap_ellcalc-hsell2}
\end{gather}
\(\overline{\lambda}\) being the biggest eigenvalue of matrix
\(Q_1\). After defining \(W_1=Q_1^{-1}\), we obtain
\({\mathcal E}(q^+,Q^+)\) from equations \eqref{chap_ellcalc-fusion1}-\eqref{chap_ellcalc-fusion5}, and
\({\mathcal E}(q^-,Q^-)\) from \eqref{chap_ellcalc-paramell1}-\eqref{chap_ellcalc-paramell2},
\eqref{chap_ellcalc-thetapar}.

\textbf{Remark.} Notice that matrix \(W_2\) has rank \(1\), which
makes it singular for \(n>1\). Nevertheless, expressions
\eqref{chap_ellcalc-fusion1}-\eqref{chap_ellcalc-fusion2}, \eqref{chap_ellcalc-paramell1}-\eqref{chap_ellcalc-paramell2} make sense because
\(W_1\) is nonsingular, \(\pi_0\neq0\) and
\(\hat{\theta}_1\neq0\).

To find the ellipsoidal approximations \({\mathcal E}(q^+,Q^+)\) and
\({\mathcal E}(q^-,Q^-)\) of the intersection of ellipsoid
\({\mathcal E}(q,Q)\) and polytope \(P(C,g)\),
\(C\in{\bf R}^{m\times n}\), \(b\in{\bf R}^m\), such that
\begin{gather}
\begin{split}{\mathcal E}(q^-,Q^-)\subseteq{\mathcal E}(q,Q)\cap P(C,g)\subseteq{\mathcal E}(q^+,Q^+),\end{split}\notag
\end{gather}
we first compute
\begin{gather}
\begin{split}{\mathcal E}(q^-_1,Q^-_1)\subseteq{\mathcal E}(q,Q)\cap{\bf S}(c_1,\gamma_1)\subseteq
{\mathcal E}(q^+_1,Q^+_1),\end{split}\notag
\end{gather}
wherein \({\bf S}(c_1,\gamma_1)\) is the halfspace defined by the
first row of matrix \(C\), \(c_1\), and the first element of
vector \(g\), \(\gamma_1\). Then, one by one, we get
\begin{gather}
\begin{split}\begin{aligned}
& & {\mathcal E}(q^-_2,Q^-_2)\subseteq{\mathcal E}(q^-_1,Q^-_1)\cap{\bf S}(c_2,\gamma_2), ~~~
{\mathcal E}(q^+_1,Q^+_1)\cap{\bf S}(c_2,\gamma_2)\subseteq{\mathcal E}(q^+_2,Q^+_2), \\
& & {\mathcal E}(q^-_3,Q^-_3)\subseteq{\mathcal E}(q^-_2,Q^-_2)\cap{\bf S}(c_3,\gamma_3), ~~~
{\mathcal E}(q^+_2,Q^+_2)\cap{\bf S}(c_3,\gamma_3)\subseteq{\mathcal E}(q^+_3,Q^+_3), \\
& & \cdots \\
& & {\mathcal E}(q^-_m,Q^-_m)\subseteq{\mathcal E}(q^-_{m-1},Q^-_{m-1})\cap{\bf S}(c_m,\gamma_m), ~~~
{\mathcal E}(q^+_{m-1},Q^+_{m-1})\cap{\bf S}(c_m,\gamma_m)\subseteq{\mathcal E}(q^+_m,Q^+_m), \\\end{aligned}\end{split}\notag
\end{gather}
The resulting ellipsoidal approximations are
\begin{gather}
\begin{split}{\mathcal E}(q^+,Q^+)={\mathcal E}(q^+_m,Q^+_m), ~~~~ {\mathcal E}(q^-,Q^-)={\mathcal E}(q^-_m,Q^-_m) .\end{split}\notag
\end{gather}

\subsection{Checking if one ellipsoid contains another}
\label{chap_ellcalc:checking-if-one-ellipsoid-contains-another}
Theorem of alternatives, also known as \(S\)-procedure {\hyperref[chap_ellcalc:boyd2004]{{[}BOYD2004{]}}},
states that the implication
\begin{gather}
\begin{split}\langle x, A_1x\rangle + 2\langle b_1,x\rangle + c_1 \leqslant0
~~ \Rightarrow ~~
\langle x, A_2x\rangle + 2\langle b_2,x\rangle + c_2 \leqslant0,\end{split}\notag
\end{gather}
where \(A_i\in{\bf R}^{n\times n}\) are symmetric matrices,
\(b_i\in{\bf R}^n\), \(c_i\in{\bf R}\), \(i=1,2\), holds if
and only if there exists \(\lambda>0\) such that
\begin{gather}
\begin{split}\left[\begin{array}{cc}
A_2 & b_2\\
b_2^T & c_2\end{array}\right]
\preceq
\lambda\left[\begin{array}{cc}
A_1 & b_1\\
b_1^T & c_1\end{array}\right].\end{split}\notag
\end{gather}
By \(S\)-procedure,
\({\mathcal E}(q_1,Q_1)\subseteq{\mathcal E}(q_2,Q_2)\) (both
ellipsoids are assumed to be nondegenerate) if and only if the following
SDP problem is feasible:
\begin{gather}
\begin{split}\min 0\end{split}\notag
\end{gather}
subject to:
\begin{gather}
\begin{split}\begin{aligned}
\lambda & >  0, \\
\left[\begin{array}{cc}
Q_2^{-1} & -Q_2^{-1}q_2\\
(-Q_2^{-1}q_2)^T & q_2^TQ_2^{-1}q_2-1\end{array}\right]
& \preceq
\lambda \left[\begin{array}{cc}
Q_1^{-1} & -Q_1^{-1}q_1\\
(-Q_1^{-1}q_1)^T & q_1^TQ_1^{-1}q_1-1\end{array}\right]\end{aligned}\end{split}\notag
\end{gather}
where \(\lambda\in{\bf R}\) is the variable.


\subsection{Minimum Volume Ellipsoids}
\label{chap_ellcalc:minimum-volume-ellipsoids}
The minimum volume ellipsoid that contains set \(S\) is called
\emph{Löwner-John ellipsoid} of the set \(S\). To characterize it we
rewrite general ellipsoid \({\mathcal E}(q,Q)\) as
\begin{gather}
\begin{split}{\mathcal E}(q,Q) = \{x ~|~ \langle (Ax + b), (Ax + b)\rangle \},\end{split}\notag
\end{gather}
where
\begin{gather}
\begin{split}A = Q^{-1/2} ~~~ \mbox{ and } ~~~ b = -Aq .\end{split}\notag
\end{gather}
For positive definite matrix \(A\), the volume of
\({\mathcal E}(q,Q)\) is proportional to \(\det A^{-1}\). So,
finding the minimum volume ellipsoid containing \(S\) can be
expressed as semidefinite programming (SDP) problem
\begin{gather}
\begin{split}\min \log \det A^{-1}\end{split}\notag
\end{gather}
subject to:
\begin{gather}
\begin{split}\sup_{v\in S} \langle (Av + b), (Av + b)\rangle \leqslant1,\end{split}\notag
\end{gather}
where the variables are \(A\in{\bf R}^{n\times n}\) and
\(b\in{\bf R}^n\), and there is an implicit constraint
\(A\succ 0\) (\(A\) is positive definite). The objective and
constraint functions are both convex in \(A\) and \(b\), so this
problem is convex. Evaluating the constraint function, however, requires
solving a convex maximization problem, and is tractable only in certain
special cases.

For a finite set \(S=\{x_1,\cdots,x_m\}\subset{\bf R}^n\), an
ellipsoid covers \(S\) if and only if it covers its convex hull. So,
finding the minimum volume ellipsoid covering \(S\) is the same as
finding the minimum volume ellipsoid containing the polytope
\({\bf conv}\{x_1,\cdots,x_m\}\). The SDP problem is
\begin{gather}
\begin{split}\min \log \det A^{-1}\end{split}\notag
\end{gather}
subject to:
\begin{gather}
\begin{split}\begin{aligned}
A & \succ  0, \\
\langle (Ax_i + b), (Ax_i + b)\rangle & \leqslant 1, ~~~ i=1..m.\end{aligned}\end{split}\notag
\end{gather}
We can find the minimum volume ellipsoid containing the union of
ellipsoids \(\bigcup_{i=1}^m{\mathcal E}(q_i,Q_i)\). Using the fact
that for \(i=1..m\)
\({\mathcal E}(q_i,Q_i)\subseteq{\mathcal E}(q,Q)\) if and only if
there exists \(\lambda_i>0\) such that
\begin{gather}
\begin{split}\left[\begin{array}{cc}
A^2 - \lambda_i Q_i^{-1} & Ab + \lambda_i Q_i^{-1}q_i\\
(Ab + \lambda_i Q_i^{-1}q_i)^T & b^Tb-1 - \lambda_i (q_i^TQ_i^{-1}q_i-1) \end{array}
\right] \preceq 0 .\end{split}\notag
\end{gather}
Changing variable \(\tilde{b}=Ab\), we get convex SDP in the
variables \(A\), \(\tilde{b}\), and
\(\lambda_1,\cdots,\lambda_m\):
\begin{gather}
\begin{split}\min \log \det A^{-1}\end{split}\notag
\end{gather}
subject to:
\begin{gather}
\begin{split}\begin{aligned}
\lambda_i & > 0,\\
\left[\begin{array}{ccc}
A^2-\lambda_iQ_i^{-1} & \tilde{b}+\lambda_iQ_i^{-1}q_i & 0 \\
(\tilde{b}+\lambda_iQ_i^{-1}q_i)^T & -1-\lambda_i(q_i^TQ_i^{-1}q_i-1) & \tilde{b}^T \\
0 & \tilde{b} & -A^2\end{array}\right] & \preceq 0, ~~~ i=1..m.\end{aligned}\end{split}\notag
\end{gather}
After \(A\) and \(b\) are found,
\begin{gather}
\begin{split}q=-A^{-1}b ~~~ \mbox{ and } ~~~ Q=(A^TA)^{-1}.\end{split}\notag
\end{gather}
The results on the minimum volume ellipsoids are explained and proven in
{\hyperref[chap_ellcalc:boyd2004]{{[}BOYD2004{]}}}.


\subsection{Maximum Volume Ellipsoids}
\label{chap_ellcalc:maximum-volume-ellipsoids}
Consider a problem of finding the maximum volume ellipsoid that lies
inside a bounded convex set \(S\) with nonempty interior. To
formulate this problem we rewrite general ellipsoid
\({\mathcal E}(q,Q)\) as
\begin{gather}
\begin{split}{\mathcal E}(q,Q) = \{Bx + q ~|~ \langle x,x\rangle\leqslant1\},\end{split}\notag
\end{gather}
where \(B=Q^{1/2}\), so the volume of \({\mathcal E}(q,Q)\) is
proportional to \(\det B\).

The maximum volume ellipsoid that lies inside \(S\) can be found by
solving the following SDP problem:
\begin{gather}
\begin{split}\max \log \det B\end{split}\notag
\end{gather}
subject to:
\begin{gather}
\begin{split}\sup_{\langle v,v\rangle\leqslant1} I_S(Bv+q)\leqslant0 ,\end{split}\notag
\end{gather}
in the variables \(B\in{\bf R}^{n\times n}\) - symmetric matrix,
and \(q\in{\bf R}^n\), with implicit constraint \(B\succ 0\),
where \(I_S\) is the indicator function:
\begin{gather}
\begin{split}I_S(x) = \left\{\begin{array}{ll}
0, & \mbox{ if } x\in S,\\
\infty, & \mbox{ otherwise.}\end{array}\right.\end{split}\notag
\end{gather}
In case of polytope, \(S=P(C,g)\) with \(P(C,g)\) defined in
\eqref{chap_ellcalc-polytope}, the SDP has the form
\begin{gather}
\begin{split}\min \log \det B^{-1}\end{split}\notag
\end{gather}
subject to:
\begin{gather}
\begin{split}\begin{aligned}
B & \succ 0,\\
\langle c_i, Bc_i\rangle + \langle c_i, q\rangle & \leqslant \gamma_i,
~~~ i=1..m.\end{aligned}\end{split}\notag
\end{gather}
We can find the maximum volume ellipsoid that lies inside the
intersection of given ellipsoids
\(\bigcap_{i=1}^m{\mathcal E}(q_i,Q_i)\). Using the fact that for
\(i=1..m\) \({\mathcal E}(q,Q)\subseteq{\mathcal E}(q_i,Q_i)\)
if and only if there exists \(\lambda_i>0\) such that
\begin{gather}
\begin{split}\left[\begin{array}{cc}
-\lambda_i - q^TQ_i^{-1}q + 2q_i^TQ_i^{-1}q - q_i^TQ_i^{-1}q_i + 1 & (Q_i^{-1}q-Q_i^{-1}q_i)^TB\\
B(Q_i^{-1}q-Q_i^{-1}q_i) & \lambda_iI-BQ_i^{-1}B\end{array}\right] \succeq 0.\end{split}\notag
\end{gather}
To find the maximum volume ellipsoid, we solve convex SDP in variables
\(B\), \(q\), and \(\lambda_1,\cdots,\lambda_m\):
\begin{gather}
\begin{split}\min \log \det B^{-1}\end{split}\notag
\end{gather}
subject to:
\begin{gather}
\begin{split}\begin{aligned}
\lambda_i & >  0, \\
\left[\begin{array}{ccc}
1-\lambda_i & 0 & (q - q_i)^T\\
0 & \lambda_iI & B\\
q - q_i & B & Q_i\end{array}\right] & \succeq  0, ~~~ i=1..m.\end{aligned}\end{split}\notag
\end{gather}
After \(B\) and \(q\) are found,
\begin{gather}
\begin{split}Q = B^TB.\end{split}\notag
\end{gather}

\chapter{Reachability}
\label{chap_reach:reachability}\label{chap_reach::doc}

\section{Basics of Reachability Analysis}
\label{chap_reach:basics-of-reachability-analysis}

\subsection{Systems without disturbances}
\label{chap_reach:systems-without-disturbances}
Consider a general continuous-time
\phantomsection\label{chap_reach:equation-ctds1}\begin{gather}
\begin{split}\dot{x}(t) = f(t, x, u),\end{split}\label{chap_reach-ctds1}
\end{gather}
or discrete-time dynamical system
\phantomsection\label{chap_reach:equation-dtds1}\begin{gather}
\begin{split}x(t+1) = f(t, x, u),\end{split}\label{chap_reach-dtds1}
\end{gather}
wherein \(t\) is time \footnote{
In discrete-time case \(t\) assumes integer values.
}, \(x\in{\bf R}^n\) is the state,
\(u\in{\bf R}^m\) is the control, and \(f\) is a measurable
vector function taking values in \({\bf R}^n\). \footnote{
We are being general when giving the basic definitions. However, it
is important to understand that for any specific \emph{continuous-time}
dynamical system it must be determined whether the solution exists
and is unique, and in which class of solutions these conditions are
met. Here we shall assume that function \(f\) is such that the
solution of the differential equation \eqref{chap_reach-ctds1} exists and is unique
in Fillipov sense. This allows the right-hand side to be
discontinuous. For discrete-time systems this problem does not exist.
} The control
values \(u(t, x(t))\) are restricted to a closed compact control set
\({\mathcal U}(t)\subset{\bf R}^m\). An \emph{open-loop} control does not
depend on the state, \(u=u(t)\); for a \emph{closed-loop} control,
\(u=u(t, x(t))\).

\textbf{Definition.} The (forward) reach set \({\mathcal X}(t, t_0, x_0)\) at time
\(t>t_0\) from the initial position \((t_0, x_0)\) is the set of
all states \(x(t)\) reachable at time \(t\) by system \eqref{chap_reach-ctds1},
or \eqref{chap_reach-dtds1}, with \(x(t_0)=x_0\) through all possible controls
\(u(\tau, x(\tau))\in{\mathcal U}(\tau)\),
\(t_0\leqslant\tau< t\). For a given set of initial states
\({\mathcal X}_0\), the reach set
\({\mathcal X}(t, t_0, {\mathcal X}_0)\) is
\phantomsection\label{chap_reach:equation-def_olrs}\begin{gather}
\begin{split}{\mathcal X}(t, t_0, {\mathcal X}_0) = \bigcup_{x_0\in{\mathcal X}_0}{\mathcal X}(t, t_0, x_0).\end{split}\label{chap_reach-def_olrs}
\end{gather}
Here are two facts about forward reach sets.
\begin{enumerate}
\item {} 
\({\mathcal X}(t, t_0, {\mathcal X}_0)\) is the same for
open-loop and closed-loop control.

\item {} 
\({\mathcal X}(t, t_0, {\mathcal X}_0)\) satisfies the semigroup
property,
\phantomsection\label{chap_reach:equation-semigroup}\begin{gather}
\begin{split}{\mathcal X}(t, t_0, {\mathcal X}_0) = {\mathcal X}(t, \tau, {\mathcal X}(\tau, t_0, {\mathcal X}_0)), \;\;\;
t_0\leqslant\tau< t.\end{split}\label{chap_reach-semigroup}
\end{gather}
\end{enumerate}

For linear systems
\phantomsection\label{chap_reach:equation-linearrhs}\begin{gather}
\begin{split}f(t, x, u) = A(t)x(t) + B(t)u,\end{split}\label{chap_reach-linearrhs}
\end{gather}
with matrices \(A(t)\) in \({\bf R}^{n\times n}\) and
\(B(t)\) in \({\bf R}^{m\times n}\). For continuous-time linear
system the state transition matrix is
\begin{gather}
\begin{split}\dot{\Phi}(t, t_0) = A(t)\Phi(t, t_0), \Phi(t, t) = I,\end{split}\notag
\end{gather}
which for constant \(A(t)\equiv A\) simplifies as
\begin{gather}
\begin{split}\Phi(t, t_0) = e^{A(t-t_0)} .\end{split}\notag
\end{gather}
For discrete-time linear system the state transition matrix is
\begin{gather}
\begin{split}\Phi(t+1, t_0) = A(t)\Phi(t, t_0), \Phi(t, t) = I,\end{split}\notag
\end{gather}
which for constant \(A(t)\equiv A\) simplifies as
\begin{gather}
\begin{split}\Phi(t, t_0) = A^{t-t_0} .\end{split}\notag
\end{gather}
If the state transition matrix is invertible,
\(\Phi^{-1}(t, t_0) = \Phi(t_0, t)\). The transition matrix is
always invertible for continuous-time and for sampled discrete-time
systems. However, if for some \(\tau\), \(t_0\leqslant\tau<t\),
\(A(\tau)\) is degenerate (singular),
\(\Phi(t, t_0)=\prod_{\tau=t_0}^{t-1}A(\tau)\), is also degenerate
and cannot be inverted.

Following Cauchy’s formula, the reach set
\({\mathcal X}(t, t_0, {\mathcal X}_0)\) for a linear system can be
expressed as
\phantomsection\label{chap_reach:equation-ctlsrs}\begin{gather}
\begin{split}{\mathcal X}(t, t_0, {\mathcal X}_0) =
\Phi(t, t_0){\mathcal X}_0 \oplus \int_{t_0}^t\Phi(t, \tau)B(\tau){\mathcal U}(\tau)d\tau\end{split}\label{chap_reach-ctlsrs}
\end{gather}
in continuous-time, and as
\phantomsection\label{chap_reach:equation-dtlsrs}\begin{gather}
\begin{split}{\mathcal X}(t, t_0, {\mathcal X}_0) =
\Phi(t, t_0){\mathcal X}_0 \oplus \sum_{\tau=t_0}^{t-1}\Phi(t, \tau+1)B(\tau){\mathcal U}(\tau)\end{split}\label{chap_reach-dtlsrs}
\end{gather}
in discrete-time case.

The operation ‘\(\oplus\)’ is the \emph{geometric sum}, also known as
\emph{Minkowski sum}. \footnote{
Minkowski sum of sets
\({\mathcal W}, {\mathcal Z}\subseteq {\bf R}^n\) is defined as
\({\mathcal W}\oplus {\mathcal Z}= \{w+z ~|~ w\in{\mathcal W}, ~ z\in{\mathcal Z}\}\).
Set \({\mathcal W}\oplus{\mathcal Z}\) is nonempty if and only if
both, \({\mathcal W}\) and \({\mathcal Z}\) are nonempty. If
\({\mathcal W}\) and \({\mathcal Z}\) are convex, set
\({\mathcal W}\oplus{\mathcal Z}\) is convex.
} The geometric sum and linear (or affine)
transformations preserve compactness and convexity. Hence, if the
initial set \({\mathcal X}_0\) and the control sets
\({\mathcal U}(\tau)\), \(t_0\leqslant\tau<t\), are compact and
convex, so is the reach set
\({\mathcal X}(t, t_0, {\mathcal X}_0)\).

\textbf{Definition.} The backward reach set \({\mathcal Y}(t_1, t, y_1)\) for the target
position \((t_1, y_1)\) is the set of all states \(y(t)\) for
which there exists some control
\(u(\tau, x(\tau))\in{\mathcal U}(\tau)\),
\(t\leqslant\tau<t_1\), that steers system \eqref{chap_reach-ctds1}, or \eqref{chap_reach-dtds1} to
the state \(y_1\) at time \(t_1\). For the target set
\({\mathcal Y}_1\) at time \(t_1\), the backward reach set
\({\mathcal Y}(t_1, t, {\mathcal Y}_1)\) is
\phantomsection\label{chap_reach:equation-def_olbrs}\begin{gather}
\begin{split}{\mathcal Y}(t_1, t, {\mathcal Y}_1) = \bigcup_{y_1\in{\mathcal Y}_1}{\mathcal Y}(t_1, t, y_1).\end{split}\label{chap_reach-def_olbrs}
\end{gather}
The backward reach set
\({\mathcal Y}(t_1, t, {\mathcal Y}_1)\) is the largest \emph{weakly
invariant} set with respect to the target set \({\mathcal Y}_1\) and
time values \(t\) and \(t_1\). \footnote{
\({\mathcal M}\) is weakly invariant with respect to the target
set \({\mathcal Y}_1\) and times \(t_0\) and \(t\), if
for every state \(x_0\in{\mathcal M}\) there exists a control
\(u(\tau, x(\tau))\in{\mathcal U}(\tau)\),
\(t_0\leqslant\tau< t\), that steers the system from \(x_0\)
at time \(t_0\) to some state in \({\mathcal Y}_1\) at time
\(t\). If \emph{all} controls in \({\mathcal U}(\tau)\),
\(t_0\leqslant\tau<t\) steer the system from every
\(x_0\in{\mathcal M}\) at time \(t_0\) to
\({\mathcal Y}_1\) at time \(t\), set \({\mathcal M}\) is
said to be \emph{strongly} invariant with respect to
\({\mathcal Y}_1\), \(t_0\) and \(t\).
}

\textbf{Remark.} Backward reach set can be computed for continuous-time
system only if the solution of \eqref{chap_reach-ctds1} exists for \(t<t_1\); and
for discrete-time system only if the right hand side of \eqref{chap_reach-dtds1} is
invertible \footnote{
There exists \(f^{-1}(t,x,u)\) such that
\(x(t)=f^{-1}(t, x(t+1), u, v)\).
}.

These two facts about the backward reach set \({\mathcal Y}\) are
similar to those for forward reach sets.
\begin{enumerate}
\item {} 
\({\mathcal Y}(t_1, t, {\mathcal Y}_1)\) is the same for
open-loop and closed-loop control.

\item {} 
\({\mathcal Y}(t_1, t, {\mathcal Y}_1)\) satisfies the semigroup
property,
\phantomsection\label{chap_reach:equation-semigroup_b}\begin{gather}
\begin{split}{\mathcal Y}(t_1, t, {\mathcal Y}_1) = {\mathcal Y}(\tau, t, {\mathcal Y}(t_1, \tau, {\mathcal Y}_1)), \;\;\;
t\leqslant\tau< t_1.\end{split}\label{chap_reach-semigroup_b}
\end{gather}
\end{enumerate}

For the linear system \eqref{chap_reach-linearrhs} the backward reach set can be
expressed as
\phantomsection\label{chap_reach:equation-ctlsbrs}\begin{gather}
\begin{split}{\mathcal Y}(t_1, t, {\mathcal Y}_1) =
\Phi(t, t_1){\mathcal Y}_1 \oplus \int_{t_1}^t\Phi(t, \tau)B(\tau){\mathcal U}(\tau)d\tau\end{split}\label{chap_reach-ctlsbrs}
\end{gather}
in the continuous-time case, and as
\phantomsection\label{chap_reach:equation-dtlsbrs}\begin{gather}
\begin{split}{\mathcal Y}(t_1, t, {\mathcal Y}_1) =
\Phi(t, t_1){\mathcal Y}_1 \oplus \sum_{\tau =t}^{t_1-1}-\Phi(t, \tau)B(\tau){\mathcal U}(\tau)\end{split}\label{chap_reach-dtlsbrs}
\end{gather}
in discrete-time case. The last formula makes sense only for
discrete-time linear systems with invertible state transition matrix.
Degenerate discrete-time linear systems have unbounded backward reach
sets and such sets cannot be computed with available software tools.

Just as in the case of forward reach set, the backward reach set of a
linear system \({\mathcal Y}(t_1, t, {\mathcal Y}_1)\) is compact
and convex if the target set \({\mathcal Y}_1\) and the control sets
\({\mathcal U}(\tau)\), \(t\leqslant\tau<t_1\), are compact and
convex.

\textbf{Remark.} In the computer science literature the reach set is said to
be the result of operator \emph{post}, and the backward reach set is the
result of operator \emph{pre}. In the control literature the backward reach
set is also called the \emph{solvability set}.


\subsection{Systems with disturbances}
\label{chap_reach:systems-with-disturbances}
Consider the continuous-time dynamical system with disturbance
\phantomsection\label{chap_reach:equation-ctds2}\begin{gather}
\begin{split}\dot{x}(t) = f(t, x, u, v),\end{split}\label{chap_reach-ctds2}
\end{gather}
or the discrete-time dynamical system with disturbance
\phantomsection\label{chap_reach:equation-dtds2}\begin{gather}
\begin{split}x(t+1) = f(t, x, u, v),\end{split}\label{chap_reach-dtds2}
\end{gather}
in which we also have the disturbance input \(v\in{\bf R}^d\) with
values \(v(t)\) restricted to a closed compact set
\({\mathcal V}(t)\subset{\bf R}^d\).

In the presence of disturbances the open-loop reach set (OLRS) is
different from the closed-loop reach set (CLRS).

Given the initial time \(t_0\), the set of initial states
\({\mathcal X}_0\), and terminal time \(t\), there are two types
of OLRS.

\textbf{Definition.} The maxmin open-loop reach set
\(\overline{{\mathcal X}}_{OL}(t, t_0, {\mathcal X}_0)\) is the set
of all states \(x\), such that for any disturbance
\(v(\tau)\in{\mathcal V}(\tau)\), there exist an initial state
\(x_0\in{\mathcal X}_0\) and a control
\(u(\tau)\in{\mathcal U}(\tau)\), \(t_0\leqslant\tau<t\), that
steers system \eqref{chap_reach-ctds2} or \eqref{chap_reach-dtds2} from \(x(t_0)=x_0\) to
\(x(t)=x\).

\textbf{Definition.} The minmax open-loop reach set
\(\underline{{\mathcal X}}_{OL}(t, t_0, {\mathcal X}_0)\) is the set
of all states \(x\), such that there exists a control
\(u(\tau)\in{\mathcal U}(\tau)\) that for all disturbances
\(v(\tau)\in{\mathcal V}(\tau)\), \(t_0\leqslant\tau<t\),
assigns an initial state \(x_0\in{\mathcal X}_0\) and steers system
\eqref{chap_reach-ctds2}, or \eqref{chap_reach-dtds2}, from \(x(t_0)=x_0\) to \(x(t)=x\).

In the maxmin case the control is chosen
\emph{after} knowing the disturbance over the entire time interval
\([t_0, t]\), whereas in the minmax case the control is chosen
\emph{before} any knowledge of the disturbance. Consequently, the OLRS do not
satisfy the semigroup property.

The terms ‘maxmin’ and ‘minmax’ come from the fact that
\(\overline{{\mathcal X}}_{OL}(t, t_0, {\mathcal X}_0)\) is the
subzero level set of the value function
\phantomsection\label{chap_reach:equation-maxminvf}\begin{gather}
\begin{split}\underline{V}(t, x) =
\max_v\min_u\{{\bf dist}(x(t_0), {\mathcal X}_0) ~|~ x(t)=x, \; u(\tau)\in{\mathcal U}(\tau), \;
v(\tau)\in{\mathcal V}(\tau), \; t_0\leqslant\tau<t\},\end{split}\label{chap_reach-maxminvf}
\end{gather}
i.e.,
\(\overline{{\mathcal X}}_{OL}(t, t_0, {\mathcal X}_0) = \{ x~|~\underline{V}(t, x) \leqslant0\}\),
and \(\underline{{\mathcal X}}_{OL}(t, t_0, {\mathcal X}_0)\) is the
subzero level set of the value function
\phantomsection\label{chap_reach:equation-minmaxvf}\begin{gather}
\begin{split}\overline{V}(t, x) =
\min_u\max_v\{{\bf dist}(x(t_0), {\mathcal X}_0) ~|~ x(t)=x, \; u(\tau)\in{\mathcal U}(\tau), \;
v(\tau)\in{\mathcal V}(\tau), \; t_0\leqslant\tau<t\},\end{split}\label{chap_reach-minmaxvf}
\end{gather}
in which \({\bf dist}(\cdot, \cdot)\) denotes Hausdorff
semidistance. \footnote{
Hausdorff semidistance between compact sets

\begin{gather}

\(\underline{V}(t, x)\leqslant\overline{V}(t, x)\),
\(\underline{{\mathcal X}}_{OL}(t, t_0, {\mathcal X}_0)\subseteq\overline{{\mathcal X}}_{OL}(t, t_0, {\mathcal X}_0)\).

Note that maxmin and minmax OLRS imply \emph{guarantees}: these are states
that can be reached no matter what the disturbance is, whether it is
known in advance (maxmin case) or not (minmax case). The OLRS may be
empty.

Fixing time instant \(\tau_1\), \(t_0<\tau_1<t\), define the
\emph{piecewise maxmin open-loop reach set with one correction},
\phantomsection\label{chap_reach:equation-maxmin1}\begin{gather}
\begin{split}\overline{{\mathcal X}}_{OL}^1(t, t_0, {\mathcal X}_0) = \overline{{\mathcal X}}_{OL}(t, \tau_1, \overline{{\mathcal X}}_{OL}(\tau_1, t_0, {\mathcal X}_0)),\end{split}\label{chap_reach-maxmin1}

\end{gather}
The piecewise maxmin OLRS
\(\overline{{\mathcal X}}_{OL}^1(t, t_0, {\mathcal X}_0)\) is the
subzero level set of the value function
\phantomsection\label{chap_reach:equation-maxminvf1}\begin{gather}
\begin{split}\underline{V}^1(t, x) =

\end{gather}
with \(V(\tau_1, x(\tau_1))\) given by \eqref{chap_reach-maxminvf}, which yields
\begin{gather}
\begin{split}\underline{V}^1(t, x) \geqslant\underline{V}(t, x),\end{split}\notag
\end{gather}
and thus,
\begin{gather}
\begin{split}\overline{{\mathcal X}}_{OL}^1(t, t_0 {\mathcal X}_0) \subseteq \overline{{\mathcal X}}_{OL}(t, t_0, {\mathcal X}_0) .\end{split}\notag
\end{gather}
On the other hand, the piecewise minmax OLRS
\(\underline{{\mathcal X}}_{OL}^1(t, t_0, {\mathcal X}_0)\) is the
subzero level set of the value function
\phantomsection\label{chap_reach:equation-minmaxvf1}\begin{gather}

with \(V(\tau_1, x(\tau_1))\) given by \eqref{chap_reach-minmaxvf}, which yields
\begin{gather}
\begin{split}\overline{V}(t, x) \geqslant\overline{V}^1(t, x),\end{split}\notag
\end{gather}
and thus,

\begin{split}\underline{{\mathcal X}}_{OL}(t, t_0 {\mathcal X}_0) \subseteq \underline{{\mathcal X}}_{OL}^1(t, t_0, {\mathcal X}_0) .\end{split}\notag
\end{gather}
We can now recursively define piecewise maxmin and minmax OLRS with
\(k\) corrections for \(t_0<\tau_1<\cdots<\tau_k<t\). The maxmin
piecewise OLRS with \(k\) corrections is
\phantomsection\label{chap_reach:equation-maxmink}\begin{gather}

\end{gather}
which is the subzero level set of the corresponding value function
\phantomsection\label{chap_reach:equation-maxminvfk}\begin{gather}
\begin{split}\underline{V}^k(t, x) = \max_v\min_u\{\underline{V}^{k-1}(\tau_k, x(\tau_k)) ~|~ x(t)=x, \;
u(\tau)\in{\mathcal U}(\tau), \; v(\tau)\in{\mathcal V}(\tau), \; \tau_k\leqslant\tau<t\}.\end{split}\label{chap_reach-maxminvfk}
\end{gather}
The minmax piecewise OLRS with \(k\) corrections is
\phantomsection\label{chap_reach:equation-minmaxk}\begin{gather}
\begin{split}\underline{{\mathcal X}}_{OL}^k(t, t_0, {\mathcal X}_0) =
\underline{{\mathcal X}}_{OL}(t, \tau_k, \underline{{\mathcal X}}_{OL}^{k-1}(\tau_k, t_0, {\mathcal X}_0)),\end{split}\label{chap_reach-minmaxk}
\end{gather}
which is the subzero level set of the corresponding value function
\phantomsection\label{chap_reach:equation-minmaxvfk}\begin{gather}
\begin{split}\begin{aligned}
\overline{V}^k(t, x) = \min_u\max_v\{\overline{V}^{k-1}(\tau_k, x(\tau_k)) ~|~ x(t)=x, \;

\end{aligned}\end{split}\label{chap_reach-minmaxvfk}
\end{gather}
From \eqref{chap_reach-maxminvf1}, \eqref{chap_reach-minmaxvf1}, \eqref{chap_reach-maxminvfk} and \eqref{chap_reach-minmaxvfk} it
follows that
\begin{gather}
\begin{split}\underline{V}(t, x) \leqslant\underline{V}^1(t, x)\leqslant\cdots

Hence,

\end{gather}
the \emph{maxmin closed-loop reach set} of system \eqref{chap_reach-ctds2} or \eqref{chap_reach-dtds2} at
time \(t\), and we call
\phantomsection\label{chap_reach:equation-minmaxclrs}\begin{gather}
\begin{split}\underline{{\mathcal X}}_{CL}(t, t_0, {\mathcal X}_0) = \underline{{\mathcal X}}_{OL}^k(t, t_0, {\mathcal X}_0), \;\;

\end{gather}
the \emph{minmax closed-loop reach set} of system \eqref{chap_reach-ctds2} or \eqref{chap_reach-dtds2} at
time \(t\).

\textbf{Definition.} Given initial time \(t_0\) and the set of initial
states \({\mathcal X}_0\), the maxmin CLRS
\(\overline{{\mathcal X}}_{CL}(t, t_0, {\mathcal X}_0)\) of system
\eqref{chap_reach-ctds2} or \eqref{chap_reach-dtds2} at time \(t>t_0\), is the set of all states
\(x\), for each of which and for every disturbance
\(v(\tau)\in{\mathcal V}(\tau)\), there exist an initial state
\(x_0\in{\mathcal X}_0\) and a control
\(u(\tau, x(\tau))\in{\mathcal U}(\tau)\), such that the trajectory
\(x(\tau | v(\tau), u(\tau, x(\tau)))\) satisfying
\(x(t_0) = x_0\) and
\begin{gather}
\begin{split}\dot{x}(\tau | v(\tau), u(\tau, x(\tau))) \in
f(\tau, x(\tau), u(\tau, x(\tau)), v(\tau))\end{split}\notag
\end{gather}
in the continuous-time case, or
\begin{gather}
\begin{split}x(\tau+1 | v(\tau), u(\tau, x(\tau))) \in
f(\tau, x(\tau), u(\tau, x(\tau)), v(\tau))\end{split}\notag
\end{gather}
in the discrete-time case, with \(t_0\leqslant\tau<t\), is such
that \(x(t)=x\).

\textbf{Definition.} Given initial time \(t_0\) and the set of initial states \({\mathcal X}_0\), the
maxmin CLRS \(\underline{{\mathcal X}}_{CL}(t, t_0, {\mathcal X}_0)\) of system
\eqref{chap_reach-ctds2} or \eqref{chap_reach-dtds2}, at time \(t>t_0\), is the set of all states
\(x\), for each of which there exists a control
\(u(\tau, x(\tau))\in{\mathcal U}(\tau)\), and for every disturbance
\(v(\tau)\in{\mathcal V}(\tau)\) there exists an initial state
\(x_0\in{\mathcal X}_0\), such that the trajectory
\(x(\tau, v(\tau) | u(\tau, x(\tau)))\) satisfying
\(x(t_0) = x_0\) and
\begin{gather}
\begin{split}\dot{x}(\tau, v(\tau) | u(\tau, x(\tau))) \in
f(\tau, x(\tau), u(\tau, x(\tau)), v(\tau))\end{split}\notag
\end{gather}
in the continuous-time case, or
\begin{gather}
\begin{split}x(\tau+1, v(\tau) | u(\tau, x(\tau))) \in
f(\tau, x(\tau), u(\tau, x(\tau)), v(\tau))\end{split}\notag
\end{gather}
in the discrete-time case, with \(t_0\leqslant\tau<t\), is such
that \(x(t)=x\).
By construction, both
maxmin and minmax CLRS satisfy the semigroup property \eqref{chap_reach-semigroup}.

For some classes of dynamical systems and some types of constraints on
initial conditions, controls and disturbances, the maxmin and minmax
CLRS may coincide. This is the case for continuous-time linear systems
with convex compact bounds on the initial set, controls and disturbances
under the condition that the initial set \({\mathcal X}_0\) is large
enough to ensure that
\({\mathcal X}(t_0+\epsilon, t_0, {\mathcal X}_0)\) is nonempty for
some small \(\epsilon>0\).

Consider the linear system case,
\phantomsection\label{chap_reach:equation-linearrhsdist}\begin{gather}
\begin{split}f(t, x, u) = A(t)x(t) + B(t)u + G(t)v,\end{split}\label{chap_reach-linearrhsdist}
\end{gather}
where \(A(t)\) and \(B(t)\) are as in \eqref{chap_reach-linearrhs}, and
\(G(t)\) takes its values in \({\bf R}^d\).

The maxmin OLRS for the continuous-time linear system can be expressed
through set valued integrals,
\phantomsection\label{chap_reach:equation-ctlsmaxmin}\begin{gather}
\begin{split}\begin{array}{l}
\overline{{\mathcal X}}_{OL}(t, t_0, {\mathcal X}_0) = \\
\left(\Phi(t, t_0){\mathcal X}_0 \oplus
\int_{t_0}^t\Phi(t, \tau)B(\tau){\mathcal U}(\tau)d\tau\right) \dot{-} \\
\int_{t_0}^t\Phi(t, \tau)(-G(\tau)){\mathcal V}(\tau)d\tau,
\end{array}\end{split}\label{chap_reach-ctlsmaxmin}
\end{gather}
and for discrete-time linear system through set-valued sums,
\phantomsection\label{chap_reach:equation-dtlsmaxmin}\begin{gather}
\begin{split}\begin{array}{l}
\overline{{\mathcal X}}_{OL}(t, t_0, {\mathcal X}_0) = \\
\left(\Phi(t, t_0){\mathcal X}_0 \oplus \sum_{\tau=t_0}^{t-1}\Phi(t, \tau+1)B(\tau){\mathcal U}(\tau)\right) \dot{-} \\
\sum_{\tau=t_0}^{t-1}\Phi(t, \tau+1)(-G(\tau)){\mathcal V}(\tau).
\end{array}\end{split}\label{chap_reach-dtlsmaxmin}
\end{gather}
Similarly, the minmax OLRS for the continuous-time linear system is
\phantomsection\label{chap_reach:equation-ctlsminmax}\begin{gather}
\begin{split}\begin{array}{l}
\underline{{\mathcal X}}_{OL}(t, t_0, {\mathcal X}_0) = \\
\left(\Phi(t, t_0){\mathcal X}_0 \dot{-}
\int_{t_0}^t\Phi(t, \tau)(-G(\tau)){\mathcal V}(\tau)d\tau\right)
\oplus \\
\int_{t_0}^t\Phi(t, \tau)B(\tau){\mathcal U}(\tau)d\tau,
\end{array}\end{split}\label{chap_reach-ctlsminmax}
\end{gather}
and for the discrete-time linear system it is
\phantomsection\label{chap_reach:equation-dtlsminmax}\begin{gather}
\begin{split}\begin{array}{l}
\underline{{\mathcal X}}_{OL}(t, t_0, {\mathcal X}_0) = \\
\left(\Phi(t, t_0){\mathcal X}_0 \dot{-} \sum_{\tau=t_0}^{t-1}\Phi(t, \tau+1)(-G(\tau)){\mathcal V}(\tau)\right) \oplus \\
\sum_{\tau=t_0}^{t-1}\Phi(t, \tau+1)B(\tau){\mathcal U}(\tau).
\end{array}\end{split}\label{chap_reach-dtlsminmax}
\end{gather}
The operation ‘\(\dot{-}\)’ is \emph{geometric difference}, also known as
\emph{Minkowski difference}. \footnote{
The Minkowski difference of sets
\({\mathcal W}, {\mathcal Z}\in{\bf R}^n\) is defined as
\({\mathcal W}\dot{-}{\mathcal Z}= \left\{\xi\in{\bf R}^n ~|~
\xi \oplus {\mathcal Z}\subseteq {\mathcal W}\right\}\). If
\({\mathcal W}\) and \({\mathcal Z}\) are convex,
\({\mathcal W}\dot{-}{\mathcal Z}\) is convex if it is nonempty.

Now consider the piecewise OLRS with \(k\) corrections. Expression

\int_{\tau_k}^t\Phi(t, \tau)B(\tau){\mathcal U}(\tau)d\tau\right) \dot{-} \\
\int_{\tau_k}^t\Phi(t, \tau)(-G(\tau)){\mathcal V}(\tau)d\tau,

in the continuous-time case, and for the discrete-time case into
\phantomsection\label{chap_reach:equation-dtlsmaxmink}\begin{gather}
\begin{split}\begin{array}{l}

\sum_{\tau=\tau_k}^{t-1}\Phi(t, \tau+1)(-G(\tau)){\mathcal V}(\tau).
\end{array}\end{split}\label{chap_reach-dtlsmaxmink}
\end{gather}
Expression \eqref{chap_reach-minmaxk} translates into

\begin{split}\begin{array}{l}
\underline{{\mathcal X}}_{OL}^k(t, t_0, {\mathcal X}_0) = \\

\end{gather}
in the continuous-time case, and for the discrete-time case into
\phantomsection\label{chap_reach:equation-dtlsminmaxk}\begin{gather}
\begin{split}\begin{array}{l}
\underline{{\mathcal X}}_{OL}^k(t, t_0, {\mathcal X}_0) = \\

\sum_{\tau=\tau_k}^{t-1}\Phi(t, \tau+1)(-G(\tau)){\mathcal V}(\tau)\right)
\oplus \\
\sum_{\tau=\tau_k}^{t-1}\Phi(t, \tau+1)B(\tau){\mathcal U}(\tau).
\end{array}\end{split}\label{chap_reach-dtlsminmaxk}
\end{gather}
Since for any
\({\mathcal W}_1, {\mathcal W}_2, {\mathcal W}_3 \subseteq {\bf R}^n\)
it is true that
\begin{gather}
\begin{split}({\mathcal W}_1 \dot{-} {\mathcal W}_2) \oplus {\mathcal W}_3 =
({\mathcal W}_1 \oplus {\mathcal W}_3) \dot{-} ({\mathcal W}_2 \oplus {\mathcal W}_3) \subseteq
({\mathcal W}_1 \oplus {\mathcal W}_3) \dot{-} {\mathcal W}_2,\end{split}\notag
\end{gather}
from \eqref{chap_reach-ctlsmaxmink}, \eqref{chap_reach-ctlsminmaxk} and from \eqref{chap_reach-dtlsmaxmink},
\eqref{chap_reach-dtlsminmaxk}, it is clear that \eqref{chap_reach-olrsinclusion} is true.
For linear systems, if the initial set \({\mathcal X}_0\), control
bounds \({\mathcal U}(\tau)\) and disturbance bounds
\({\mathcal V}(\tau)\), \(t_0\leqslant\tau<t\), are compact and
convex, the CLRS
\(\overline{{\mathcal X}}_{CL}(t, t_0, {\mathcal X}_0)\) and
\(\underline{{\mathcal X}}_{CL}(t, t_0, {\mathcal X}_0)\) are
compact and convex, provided they are nonempty. For continuous-time
linear systems,
\(\overline{{\mathcal X}}_{CL}(t, t_0, {\mathcal X}_0) = \underline{{\mathcal X}}_{CL}(t, t_0, {\mathcal X}_0) = {\mathcal X}_{CL}(t, t_0, {\mathcal X}_0)\).

Just as for forward reach sets, the backward reach sets can be open-loop
(OLBRS) or closed-loop (CLBRS).

\textbf{Definition.} Given the terminal time \(t_1\) and target set
\({\mathcal Y}_1\), the maxmin open-loop backward reach set
\(\overline{{\mathcal Y}}_{OL}(t_1, t, {\mathcal Y}_1)\) of system
\eqref{chap_reach-ctds2} or \eqref{chap_reach-dtds2} at time \(t<t_1\), is the set of all \(y\),
such that for any disturbance \(v(\tau)\in{\mathcal V}(\tau)\) there
exists a terminal state \(y_1\in{\mathcal Y}_1\) and control
\(u(\tau)\in{\mathcal U}(\tau)\), \(t\leqslant\tau<t_1\), which
steers the system from \(y(t)=y\) to \(y(t_1)=y_1\).

\(\overline{{\mathcal Y}}_{OL}(t_1, t, {\mathcal Y}_1)\) is the
subzero level set of the value function
\phantomsection\label{chap_reach:equation-maxminvfb}\begin{gather}

\eqref{chap_reach-ctds2} or \eqref{chap_reach-dtds2} at time \(t<t_1\), is the set of all \(y\),
such that there exists a control \(u(\tau)\in{\mathcal U}(\tau)\)
that for all disturbances \(v(\tau\in{\mathcal V}(\tau)\),
\(t\leqslant\tau<t_1\), assigns a terminal state

v(\tau)\in{\mathcal V}(\tau), \; t\leqslant\tau<t_1\},
\end{aligned}\end{split}\label{chap_reach-minmaxvfb}
\end{gather}
\textbf{Remark.} The backward reach set can be computed for a continuous-time
system only if the solution of \eqref{chap_reach-ctds2} exists for \(t<t_1\), and
for a discrete-time system only if the right hand side of \eqref{chap_reach-dtds2} is
invertible.

Similarly to the forward reachability case, we construct piecewise OLBRS
with one correction at time \(\tau_1\), \(t<\tau_1<t_1\). The

Recursively define maxmin and minmax OLBRS with \(k\) corrections

From \eqref{chap_reach-maxminvfb1}, \eqref{chap_reach-minmaxvfb1}, \eqref{chap_reach-maxminvfbk} and \eqref{chap_reach-minmaxvfbk}
it follows that

Both
maxmin and minmax CLBRS satisfy the semigroup property
\eqref{chap_reach-semigroup_b}.

The maxmin OLBRS for the continuous-time linear system can be expressed
through set valued integrals,

\begin{split}\begin{array}{l}
\overline{{\mathcal Y}}_{OL}(t_1, t, {\mathcal Y}_1) = \\

Now consider piecewise OLBRS with \(k\) corrections. Expression

\sum_{\tau=t}^{\tau_k-1}-\Phi(t, \tau+1)B(\tau){\mathcal U}(\tau).
\end{array}\end{split}\label{chap_reach-dtlsminmaxbk}
\end{gather}
For continuous-time linear systems
\(\overline{{\mathcal Y}}_{CL}(t_1, t, {\mathcal Y}_1) = \underline{{\mathcal Y}}_{CL}(t_1, t, {\mathcal Y}_1) = {\mathcal Y}_{CL}(t_1, t, {\mathcal Y}_1)\)
under the condition that the target set \({\mathcal Y}_1\) is large
enough to ensure that
\(\underline{{\mathcal Y}}_{CL}(t_1, t_1-\epsilon, {\mathcal Y}_1)\)
is nonempty for some small \(\epsilon>0\).

Computation of backward reach sets for discrete-time linear systems
makes sense only if the state transition matrix \(\Phi(t_1, t)\) is
invertible.

If the target set \({\mathcal Y}_1\), control sets
\({\mathcal U}(\tau)\) and disturbance sets
\({\mathcal V}(\tau)\), \(t\leqslant\tau<t_1\), are compact and
convex, then CLBRS
\(\overline{{\mathcal Y}}_{CL}(t_1, t, {\mathcal Y}_1)\) and
\(\underline{{\mathcal Y}}_{CL}(t_1, t, {\mathcal Y}_1)\) are
compact and convex, if they are nonempty.


\subsection{Reachability problem}
\label{chap_reach:reachability-problem}
Reachability analysis is concerned with the computation of the forward
\({\mathcal X}(t, t_0, {\mathcal X}_0)\) and backward
\({\mathcal Y}(t_1, t, {\mathcal Y}_1)\) reach sets (the reach sets
may be maxmin or minmax) in a way that can effectively meet requests
like the following:
\begin{enumerate}
\item {} 
For the given time interval \([t_0, t]\), determine whether the
system can be steered into the given target set
\({\mathcal Y}_1\). In other words, is the set
\({\mathcal Y}_1\cap\bigcup_{t_0 \leqslant\tau\leqslant t}{\mathcal X}(\tau, t_0, {\mathcal X}_0)\)
nonempty? And if the answer is ‘yes’, find a control that steers the
system to the target set (or avoids the target set). \footnote{
So-called verification problems often consist in ensuring that the
system is unable to reach an ‘unsafe’ target set within a given time
interval.
}

\item {} 
If the target set \({\mathcal Y}_1\) is reachable from the given
initial condition \(\{t_0, {\mathcal X}_0\}\) in the time
interval \([t_0, t]\), find the shortest time to reach
\({\mathcal Y}_1\),
\begin{gather}
\begin{split}\arg\min_{\tau}
\{{\mathcal X}(\tau,t_0,{\mathcal X}_0)\cap{\mathcal Y}_1\neq\emptyset ~|~ t_0\leqslant\tau\leqslant t\}.\end{split}\notag
\end{gather}
\item {} 
Given the terminal time \(t_1\), target set
\({\mathcal Y}_1\) and time \(t<t_1\) find the set of states
starting at time \(t\) from which the system can reach
\({\mathcal Y}_1\) within time interval \([t, t_1]\). In
other words, find
\(\bigcup_{t\leqslant\tau<t_1}{\mathcal Y}(t_1, \tau, {\mathcal Y}_1)\).

\item {} 
Find a closed-loop control that steers a system with disturbances to
the given target set in given time.

\item {} 
Graphically display the projection of the reach set along any
specified two- or three-dimensional subspace.

\end{enumerate}

For linear systems, if the initial set \({\mathcal X}_0\), target
set \({\mathcal Y}_1\), control bounds \({\mathcal U}(\cdot)\)
and disturbance bounds \({\mathcal V}(\cdot)\) are compact and
convex, so are the forward \({\mathcal X}(t, t_0, {\mathcal X}_0)\)
and backward \({\mathcal Y}(t_1, t, {\mathcal Y}_1)\) reach sets.
Hence reachability analysis requires the computationally effective
manipulation of convex sets, and performing the set-valued operations of
unions, intersections, geometric sums and differences.

Existing reach set computation tools can deal reliably only with linear
systems with convex constraints. A claim that certain tool or method can
be used \emph{effectively} for nonlinear systems must be treated with
caution, and the first question to ask is for what class of nonlinear
systems and with what limit on the state space dimension does this tool
work? Some “reachability methods for nonlinear systems” reduce to the
local linearization of a system followed by the use of well-tested
techniques for linear system reach set computation. Thus these
approaches in fact use reachability methods for linear systems.


\section{Ellipsoidal Method}
\label{chap_reach:ellipsoidal-method}

\subsection{Continuous-time systems}
\label{chap_reach:continuous-time-systems}
Consider the system
\phantomsection\label{chap_reach:equation-ctsystem}\begin{gather}
\begin{split}\dot{x}(t) = A(t)x(t) + B(t)u + G(t)v,\end{split}\label{chap_reach-ctsystem}
\end{gather}
in which \(x\in{\bf R}^n\) is the state, \(u\in{\bf R}^m\) is
the control and \(v\in{\bf R}^d\) is the disturbance. \(A(t)\),
\(B(t)\) and \(G(t)\) are continuous and take their values in
\({\bf R}^{n\times n}\), \({\bf R}^{n\times m}\) and
\({\bf R}^{n\times d}\) respectively. Control \(u(t,x(t))\) and
disturbance \(v(t)\) are measurable functions restricted by
ellipsoidal constraints: \(u(t,x(t)) \in {\mathcal E}(p(t), P(t))\)
and \(v(t) \in {\mathcal E}(q(t), Q(t))\). The set of initial states
at initial time \(t_0\) is assumed to be the ellipsoid
\({\mathcal E}(x_0,X_0)\).

The reach sets for systems with disturbances computed by the Ellipsoidal
Toolbox are CLRS. Henceforth, when describing backward reachability,
reach sets refer to CLRS or CLBRS. Recall that for continuous-time
linear systems maxmin and minmax CLRS coincide, and the same is true for
maxmin and minmax CLBRS.

If the matrix \(Q(\cdot)=0\), the system \eqref{chap_reach-ctsystem} becomes an
ordinary affine system with known \(v(\cdot)=q(\cdot)\). If
\(G(\cdot) = 0\), the system becomes linear. For these two cases
(\(Q(\cdot)=0\) or \(G(\cdot)=0\)) the reach set is as given in
definition \eqref{chap_reach-def_olrs}, and so the reach set will be denoted as
\({\mathcal X}_{CL}(t, t_0, {\mathcal E}(x_0, X_0)) = {\mathcal X}(t, t_0, {\mathcal E}(x_0,X_0))\).

The reach set \({\mathcal X}(t,t_0,{\mathcal E}(x_0,X_0))\) is a
symmetric compact convex set, whose center evolves in time according to
\phantomsection\label{chap_reach:equation-fwdcenter}\begin{gather}
\begin{split}\dot{x}_c(t) = A(t)x_c(t) + B(t)p(t) + G(t)q(t), \;\;\;
x_c(t_0)=x_0.\end{split}\label{chap_reach-fwdcenter}
\end{gather}
Fix a vector \(l_0\in{\bf R}^n\), and consider the solution
\(l(t)\) of the adjoint equation
\phantomsection\label{chap_reach:equation-adjointct}\begin{gather}
\begin{split}\dot{l}(t) = -A^T(t)l(t), \;\;\; l(t_0) = l_0,\end{split}\label{chap_reach-adjointct}
\end{gather}
which is equivalent to
\begin{gather}
\begin{split}l(t) = \Phi^T(t_0, t)l_0.\end{split}\notag
\end{gather}
If the reach set \({\mathcal X}(t, t_0, {\mathcal E}(x_0,X_0))\) is
nonempty, there exist tight external and tight internal approximating
ellipsoids \({\mathcal E}(x_c(t), X^+_l(t))\) and
\({\mathcal E}(x_c(t), X^-_l(t))\), respectively, such that
\phantomsection\label{chap_reach:equation-fwdinclusion}\begin{gather}
\begin{split}{\mathcal E}(x_c(t), X^-_l(t))\subseteq{\mathcal X}(t,t_0,{\mathcal E}(x_0,X_0))
\subseteq {\mathcal E}(x_c(t), X^+_l(t)),\end{split}\label{chap_reach-fwdinclusion}
\end{gather}
and
\phantomsection\label{chap_reach:equation-fwdtightness}\begin{gather}
\begin{split}\rho(l(t) ~|~ {\mathcal E}(x_c(t), X^-_l(t))) =
\rho(l(t) ~|~ {\mathcal X}(t, t_0, {\mathcal E}(x_0,X_0))) =
\rho(l(t) ~|~ {\mathcal E}(x_c(t), X^+_l(t))) .\end{split}\label{chap_reach-fwdtightness}
\end{gather}
The equation for the shape matrix of the external ellipsoid is
\phantomsection\label{chap_reach:equation-fwdext1}\begin{gather}
\begin{split}\dot{X}^+_l(t) & = A(t)X^+_l(t) + X^+_l(t)A^T(t) +\nonumber \\
&\pi_l(t)X^+_l(t) + \frac{1}{\pi_l(t)}B(t)P(t)B^T(t) -\nonumber \\
& (X_l^{+}(t))^{1/2}S_l(t)(G(t)Q(t)G^T(t))^{1/2} \nonumber -\\
& (G(t)Q(t)G^T(t))^{1/2}S_l^T(t)(X_l^{+}(t))^{1/2}, \\\end{split}\label{chap_reach-fwdext1}
\end{gather}\phantomsection\label{chap_reach:equation-fwdext2}\begin{gather}
\begin{split}X^+_l(t_0) =X_0,\end{split}\label{chap_reach-fwdext2}
\end{gather}
in which
\begin{gather}
\begin{split}\pi_l(t) = \frac{\langle l(t),
B(t)P(t)B^T(t)l(t)\rangle^{1/2}}{\langle l(t), X^+_l(t)l(t)\rangle^{1/2}},\end{split}\notag
\end{gather}
and the orthogonal matrix \(S_l(t)\) (\(S_l(t)S_l^T(t) = I\))
is determined by the equation
\begin{gather}
\begin{split}S_l(t)(G(t)Q(t)G^T(t))^{1/2}l(t) = \frac{\langle l(t),
G(t)Q(t)G^T(t)l(t)\rangle^{1/2}}{\langle l(t),
X_l^+(t)l(t)\rangle^{1/2}}(X_l^{+}(t))^{1/2}l(t).\end{split}\notag
\end{gather}
In the presence of disturbance, if the reach set is empty, the matrix
\(X^+_l(t)\) becomes sign indefinite. For a system without
disturbance, the terms containing \(G(t)\) and \(Q(t)\) vanish
from the equation \eqref{chap_reach-fwdext1}.

The equation for the shape matrix of the internal ellipsoid is
\phantomsection\label{chap_reach:equation-fwdint1}\begin{gather}
\begin{split}\dot{X}^-_l(t) & = A(t)X^-_l(t) + X^-_l(t)A^T(t) +\nonumber \\
& (X_l^{-}(t))^{1/2}T_l(t)(B(t)P(t)B^T(t))^{1/2} +\nonumber \\
& (B(t)P(t)B^T(t))^{1/2}T_l^T(t)(X_l^{-}(t))^{1/2} -\nonumber \\
& \eta_l(t)X^-_l(t) - \frac{1}{\eta_l(t)}G(t)Q(t)G^T(t), \\\end{split}\label{chap_reach-fwdint1}
\end{gather}\phantomsection\label{chap_reach:equation-fwdint2}\begin{gather}
\begin{split}X^-_l(t_0) = X_0,\end{split}\label{chap_reach-fwdint2}
\end{gather}
in which
\begin{gather}
\begin{split}\eta_l(t) = \frac{\langle l(t),
G(t)Q(t)G^T(t)l(t)\rangle^{1/2}}{\langle l(t), X^+_l(t)l(t)\rangle^{1/2}},\end{split}\notag
\end{gather}
and the orthogonal matrix \(T_l(t)\) is determined by the equation
\begin{gather}
\begin{split}T_l(t)(B(t)P(t)B^T(t))^{1/2}l(t) = \frac{\langle l(t),
B(t)P(t)B^T(t)l(t)\rangle^{1/2}}{\langle l(t),
X_l^-(t)l(t)\rangle^{1/2}}(X_l^{-}(t))^{1/2}l(t).\end{split}\notag
\end{gather}
Similarly to the external case, the terms containing \(G(t)\) and
\(Q(t)\) vanish from the equation \eqref{chap_reach-fwdint1} for a system without
disturbance.

The point where the external and internal ellipsoids touch the boundary
of the reach set is given by
\begin{gather}
\begin{split}x_l^*(t) = x_c(t) +
\frac{X^+_l(t)l(t)}{\langle l(t), X^+_l(t)l(t)\rangle^{1/2}} .\end{split}\notag
\end{gather}
The boundary points \(x^*_l(t)\) form trajectories, which we call
\emph{extremal trajectories}. Due to the nonsingular nature of the state
transition matrix \(\Phi(t,t_0)\), every boundary point of the reach
set belongs to an extremal trajectory. To follow an extremal trajectory
specified by parameter \(l_0\), the system has to start at time
\(t_0\) at initial state
\phantomsection\label{chap_reach:equation-x0lct}\begin{gather}
\begin{split}x^0_l = x_0 + \frac{X_0l_0}{\langle l_0,X_0l_0\rangle^{1/2}}.\end{split}\label{chap_reach-x0lct}
\end{gather}
In the absence of disturbances, the open-loop control
\phantomsection\label{chap_reach:uct-label}\phantomsection\label{chap_reach:equation-uct}\begin{gather}
\begin{split}u_l(t) = p(t) + \frac{P(t)B^T(t)l(t)}{\langle l(t),
B(t)P(t)B^T(t)l(t)\rangle^{1/2}}.\end{split}\label{chap_reach-uct}
\end{gather}
steers the system along the extremal trajectory defined by the vector
\(l_0\). When a disturbance is present, this control keeps the
system on an extremal trajectory if and only if the disturbance plays
against the control always taking its extreme values.

Expressions \eqref{chap_reach-fwdinclusion} and \eqref{chap_reach-fwdtightness} lead to the following
fact,
\begin{gather}
\begin{split}\bigcup_{\langle l_0,l_0\rangle=1}{\mathcal E}(x_c(t),X^-_l(t)) =
{\mathcal X}(t,t_0,{\mathcal E}(x_0,X_0)) =
\bigcap_{\langle l_0,l_0\rangle=1}{\mathcal E}(x_c(t),X^+_l(t)).\end{split}\notag
\end{gather}
In practice this means that the more values of \(l_0\) we use to
compute \(X^+_l(t)\) and \(X^-_l(t)\), the better will be our
approximation.

Analogous results hold for the backward reach set.

Given the terminal time \(t_1\) and ellipsoidal target set
\({\mathcal E}_(y_1,Y_1)\), the CLBRS
\({\mathcal Y}_{CL}(t_1, t, {\mathcal Y}_1)={\mathcal Y}(t_1, t, {\mathcal Y}_1)\),
\(t<t_1\), if it is nonempty, is a symmetric compact convex set
whose center is governed by
\phantomsection\label{chap_reach:equation-bckcenter}\begin{gather}
\begin{split}y_c(t) = Ay_c(t) + B(t)p(t) + G(t)q(t), \;\;\; y_c(t_1) = y_1.\end{split}\label{chap_reach-bckcenter}
\end{gather}
Fix a vector \(l_1\in{\bf R}^n\), and consider
\phantomsection\label{chap_reach:equation-bckadjoint}\begin{gather}
\begin{split}l(t) = \Phi(t_1, t)^Tl_1 .\end{split}\label{chap_reach-bckadjoint}
\end{gather}
If the backward reach set
\({\mathcal Y}(t_1, t, {\mathcal E}(y_1,Y_1))\) is nonempty, there
exist tight external and tight internal approximating ellipsoids
\({\mathcal E}(y_c(t), Y^+_l(t))\) and
\({\mathcal E}(y_c(t), Y^-_l(t))\) respectively, such that
\phantomsection\label{chap_reach:equation-bckinclusion}\begin{gather}
\begin{split}{\mathcal E}(y_c(t), Y^-_l(t))\subseteq{\mathcal Y}(t_1,t,{\mathcal E}(y_1,Y_1))

\end{gather}
and

Just as in the forward reachability case, the terms containing
\(G(t)\) and \(Q(t)\) vanish from equations \eqref{chap_reach-bckext1} and
\eqref{chap_reach-bckint1} in the absence of disturbances. The boundary value problems
\eqref{chap_reach-bckcenter}, \eqref{chap_reach-bckext1} and \eqref{chap_reach-bckint1} are converted to the initial

\textbf{Remark.} In expressions \eqref{chap_reach-fwdext1}, \eqref{chap_reach-fwdint1}, \eqref{chap_reach-bckext1} and
\eqref{chap_reach-bckint1} the terms \(\frac{1}{\pi_l(t)}\) and
\(\frac{1}{\eta_l(t)}\) may not be well defined for some vectors
\(l\), because matrices \(B(t)P(t)B^T(t)\) and
\(G(t)Q(t)G^T(t)\) may be singular. In such cases, we set these
entire expressions to zero.


\subsection{Discrete-time systems}
\label{chap_reach:discrete-time-systems}
Consider the discrete-time linear system,
\phantomsection\label{chap_reach:equation-dtsystem}\begin{gather}
\begin{split}x(t+1) = A(t)x(t) + B(t)u(t,x(t)) + G(t)v(t),\end{split}\label{chap_reach-dtsystem}
\end{gather}
in which \(x(t)\in{\bf R}^n\) is the state,
\(u(t, x(t))\in{\bf R}^m\) is the control bounded by the ellipsoid
\({\mathcal E}(p(t),P(t))\), \(v(t)\in{\bf R}^d\) is disturbance
bounded by ellipsoid \({\mathcal E}(q(t),Q(t))\), and matrices
\(A(t)\), \(B(t)\), \(G(t)\) are in
\({\bf R}^{n\times n}\), \({\bf R}^{n\times m}\),
\({\bf R}^{n\times d}\) respectively. Here we shall assume
\(A(t)\) to be nonsingular. \footnote{
The case when \(A(t)\) is singular is described in {\hyperref[chap_reach:var2007]{{[}VAR2007{]}}}.
The idea is to substitute \(A(t)\) with the
nonsingular \(A_\delta(t) = A(t) + \delta U(t)W(t)\), in which
\(U(t)\) and \(W(t)\) are obtained from the singular value
decomposition
\begin{gather}
\begin{split}A(t) = U(t)\Sigma(t)V(t) .\end{split}\notag
\end{gather}
The parameter \(\delta\) can be chosen based on the number of
time steps for which the reach set must be computed and the required
accuracy. The issue of inverting ill-conditioned matrices is also
addressed in {\hyperref[chap_reach:var2007]{{[}VAR2007{]}}}.
} The set of initial conditions at
initial time \(t_0\) is ellipsoid \({\mathcal E}(x_0,X_0)\).

Ellipsoidal Toolbox computes maxmin and minmax CLRS
\(\overline{{\mathcal X}}_{CL}(t, t_0, {\mathcal E}(x_0, X_0)\) and
\(\underline{{\mathcal X}}_{CL}(t, t_0, {\mathcal E}(x_0, X_0)\) for
discrete-time systems.

If matrix \(Q(\cdot)=0\), the system \eqref{chap_reach-dtsystem} becomes an
ordinary affine system with known \(v(\cdot)=q(\cdot)\). If matrix
\(G(\cdot)=0\), the system reduces to a linear controlled system. In
the absence of disturbance (\(Q(\cdot)=0\) or \(G(\cdot)=0\)),
\(\overline{{\mathcal X}}_{CL}(t,t_0,{\mathcal E}(x_0,X_0))=\underline{{\mathcal X}}_{CL}(t,t_0,{\mathcal E}(x_0,X_0))={\mathcal X}(t,t_0,{\mathcal E}(x_0,X_0))\),
the reach set is as in definition \eqref{chap_reach-def_olrs}.

Maxmin and minmax CLRS
\(\overline{{\mathcal X}}_{CL}(t, t_0, {\mathcal E}(x_0, X_0)\) and
\(\underline{{\mathcal X}}_{CL}(t, t_0, {\mathcal E}(x_0, X_0)\), if
nonempty, are symmetric convex and compact, with the center evolving in
time according to
\phantomsection\label{chap_reach:equation-fwdcenterd}\begin{gather}
\begin{split}x_c(t+1) = A(t)x_c(t) + B(t)p(t) + G(t)v(t), \\
x_c(t_0)= x_0.\end{split}\label{chap_reach-fwdcenterd}
\end{gather}
Fix some vector \(l_0\in{\bf R}^n\) and consider \(l(t)\) that
satisfies the discrete-time adjoint equation, \footnote{
Note that for \eqref{chap_reach-adjointdt} \(A(t)\) must be invertible.
}
\phantomsection\label{chap_reach:equation-adjointdt}\begin{gather}

or, equivalently
\begin{gather}
\begin{split}l(t) = \Phi^T(t_0, t)l_0 .\end{split}\notag

\section{Additional Software}
\label{chap_install:additional-software}
These packages aren’t included in the ET distribution. So, you need to
download them separately.


\subsection{CVX}
\label{chap_install:cvx}
Some methods of the \emph{Ellipsoidal Toolbox}, namely,
\begin{itemize}
\item {} 
distance

\item {} 
intersect

\item {} 
isInside

\item {} 
doesContain

\item {} 
ellintersection\_ia

\item {} 
ellunion\_ea

\end{itemize}

require solving semidefinite programming (SDP) problems.
We use CVX {\hyperref[chap_install:cvxhp]{{[}CVXHP{]}}} as an interface to an external SDP solver. CVX is a
reliable toolbox for solving SDP problems of high dimensionality. CVX is
implemented in Matlab, effectively turning Matlab into an optimization
modeling language. Model specifications are constructed using common
Matlab operations and functions, and standard Matlab code can be freely
mixed with these specifications. This combination makes it simple to
perform the calculations needed to form optimization problems, or to
process the results obtained from their solution. CVX distribution
includes two freeware solvers: SeDuMi ({\hyperref[chap_install:stur1999]{{[}STUR1999{]}}}, {\hyperref[chap_install:sdmhp]{{[}SDMHP{]}}})
and SDPT3 {\hyperref[chap_install:sdpt3hp]{{[}SDPT3HP{]}}}. The default solver used in the toolbox
is SeDuMi.


\subsection{MPT}
\label{chap_install:mpt}
Multi-Parametric Toolbox {\hyperref[chap_install:mpthp]{{[}MPTHP{]}}} - a
Matlab toolbox for multi-parametric optimization and computational
geometry. MPT is a toolbox that defines polytope class used in \emph{ET}. We
need MPT for the following methods operating with polytopes.
\begin{itemize}
\item {} 
distance

\item {} 
intersect

\item {} 
intersection\_ia

\item {} 
intersection\_ea

\item {} 
isInside

\item {} 
hyperplane2polytope

\item {} 
polytope2hyperplane

\end{itemize}

\section{Operations with ellipsoids}
\label{chap_implement:operations-with-ellipsoids}
In the \emph{Ellipsoidal Toolbox} we define a new class ellipsoid inside the
MATLAB programming environment. The following three commands define the
same ellipsoid \({\mathcal E}(q,Q)\), with \(q\in{\bf R}^n\) and
\(Q\in{\bf R}^{n\times n}\) being symmetric positive semidefinite:

\begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\},numbers=left,firstnumber=1,stepnumber=1]
 \PYG{n}{centVec} \PYG{p}{=} \PYG{p}{[}\PYG{l+m+mi}{1} \PYG{l+m+mi}{2}\PYG{p}{]}\PYG{o}{\PYGZsq{}}\PYG{p}{;}
 \PYG{n}{shMat} \PYG{p}{=} \PYG{n+nb}{eye}\PYG{p}{(}\PYG{l+m+mi}{2}\PYG{p}{,} \PYG{l+m+mi}{2}\PYG{p}{)}\PYG{p}{;}
 \PYG{n}{ellObj} \PYG{p}{=} \PYG{n}{ellipsoid}\PYG{p}{(}\PYG{n}{centVec}\PYG{p}{,} \PYG{n}{shMat}\PYG{p}{)}\PYG{p}{;}
 \PYG{n}{ellObj} \PYG{p}{=} \PYG{n}{ellipsoid}\PYG{p}{(}\PYG{n}{shMat}\PYG{p}{)} \PYG{o}{+} \PYG{n}{centVec}\PYG{p}{;}
 \PYG{n}{ellObj} \PYG{p}{=} \PYG{n}{sqrtm}\PYG{p}{(}\PYG{n}{shMat}\PYG{p}{)}\PYG{o}{*}\PYG{n}{ell\PYGZus{}unitball}\PYG{p}{(}\PYG{n+nb}{size}\PYG{p}{(}\PYG{n}{shMat}\PYG{p}{,} \PYG{l+m+mi}{1}\PYG{p}{)}\PYG{p}{)} \PYG{o}{+} \PYG{n}{centVec}\PYG{p}{;}
\end{Verbatim}

For the ellipsoid class we overload the following functions and
operators:
\begin{itemize}
\item {} 
isEmpty(ellObj) - checks if \({\mathcal E}(q,Q)\) is an empty
ellipsoid.

\item {} 
display(ellObj) - displays the details of ellipsoid
\({\mathcal E}(q,Q)\), namely, its center \(q\) and the shape
matrix \(Q\).

\item {} 
plot(ellObj) - plots ellipsoid \({\mathcal E}(q,Q)\) if its
dimension is not greater than 3.

\item {} 
firstEllObj == secEllObj - checks if ellipsoids
\({\mathcal E}(q_1,Q_1)\) and \({\mathcal E}(q_2,Q_2)\) are
equal.

\item {} 
firstEllObj \textasciitilde{}= secEllObj - checks if ellipsoids
\({\mathcal E}(q_1,Q_1)\) and \({\mathcal E}(q_2,Q_2)\) are
not equal.

\item {} 
{[} , {]} - concatenates the ellipsoids into the horizontal array, e.g. ellVec
= {[}firstEllObj secEllObj thirdEllObj{]}.

\item {} 
{[} ; {]} - concatenates the ellipsoids into the vertical array, e.g. ellMat =
{[}firstEllObj secEllObj; thirdEllObj fourthEllObj{]} defines
\(2\times 2\) array of ellipsoids.

\item {} 
firstEllObj \textgreater{}= secEllObj - checks if the ellipsoid firstEllObj is
bigger than the ellipsoid secEllObj, or equivalently
\({\mathcal E}(0,Q_1)\subseteq{\mathcal E}(0,Q_2)\).

\item {} 
firstEllObj \textless{}= secEllObj - checks if
\({\mathcal E}(0,Q_2)\subseteq{\mathcal E}(0,Q_1)\).

\item {} 
-ellObj - defines ellipsoid \({\mathcal E}(-q,Q)\).

\item {} 
ellObj + bScal - defines ellipsoid \({\mathcal E}(q+b,Q)\).

\item {} 
ellObj - bScal - defines ellipsoid \({\mathcal E}(q-b,Q)\).

\item {} 
aMat * ellObj - defines ellipsoid \({\mathcal E}(q,AQA^T)\).

\item {} 
ellObj.inv() - inverts the shape matrix of the ellipsoid:
\({\mathcal E}(q,Q^{-1})\).

\end{itemize}

All the listed operations can be applied to a single ellipsoid as well
as to a two-dimensional array of ellipsoids. For example,

\begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\},numbers=left,firstnumber=1,stepnumber=1]
\PYG{c}{\PYGZpc{} nondegenerate ellipsoid in R\PYGZca{}2}
\PYG{n}{firstEllObj} \PYG{p}{=} \PYG{n}{ellipsoid}\PYG{p}{(}\PYG{p}{[}\PYG{l+m+mi}{2}\PYG{p}{;} \PYG{o}{\PYGZhy{}}\PYG{l+m+mi}{1}\PYG{p}{]}\PYG{p}{,} \PYG{p}{[}\PYG{l+m+mi}{9} \PYG{o}{\PYGZhy{}}\PYG{l+m+mi}{5}\PYG{p}{;} \PYG{o}{\PYGZhy{}}\PYG{l+m+mi}{5} \PYG{l+m+mi}{4}\PYG{p}{]}\PYG{p}{)}\PYG{p}{;} 
\PYG{n}{secEllObj} \PYG{p}{=} \PYG{n}{firstEllObj}\PYG{p}{.}\PYG{n}{polar}\PYG{p}{(}\PYG{p}{)}\PYG{p}{;}\PYG{c}{\PYGZpc{} secEll is polar ellipsoid for firstEllObj}
\PYG{c}{\PYGZpc{} thirdEllObj is generated from secEllObj by inverting its shape matrix}
\PYG{n}{thirdEllObj} \PYG{p}{=} \PYG{n}{secEllObj}\PYG{p}{.}\PYG{n}{getInv}\PYG{p}{(}\PYG{p}{)}\PYG{p}{;} 
\PYG{c}{\PYGZpc{} 2x2 array of ellipsoids}
\PYG{n}{ellMat} \PYG{p}{=} \PYG{p}{[}\PYG{n}{firstEllObj} \PYG{n}{secEllObj}\PYG{p}{;} \PYG{n}{thirdEllObj} \PYG{n}{ellipsoid}\PYG{p}{(}\PYG{p}{[}\PYG{l+m+mi}{1}\PYG{p}{;} \PYG{l+m+mi}{1}\PYG{p}{]}\PYG{p}{,} \PYG{n+nb}{eye}\PYG{p}{(}\PYG{l+m+mi}{2}\PYG{p}{)}\PYG{p}{)}\PYG{p}{]}\PYG{p}{;} 
\PYG{c}{\PYGZpc{} check if firstEllObj is bigger than each of the ellipsoids in ellMat}
\PYG{n}{ellMat} \PYG{o}{\PYGZlt{}}\PYG{p}{=} \PYG{n}{firstEllObj}  

\PYG{c}{\PYGZpc{} ans =}
\PYG{c}{\PYGZpc{} }
\PYG{c}{\PYGZpc{}      1     0}
\PYG{c}{\PYGZpc{}      1     0}
\end{Verbatim}

To access individual elements of the array, the usual MATLAB subindexing is used:

\begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\},numbers=left,firstnumber=1,stepnumber=1]
\PYG{n}{aMat} \PYG{p}{=} \PYG{p}{[}\PYG{l+m+mi}{0} \PYG{l+m+mi}{1}\PYG{p}{;} \PYG{o}{\PYGZhy{}}\PYG{l+m+mi}{2} \PYG{l+m+mi}{0}\PYG{p}{]}\PYG{p}{;}  \PYG{c}{\PYGZpc{} aMat \PYGZhy{} 2x2 real matrix}
\PYG{n}{bVec} \PYG{p}{=} \PYG{p}{[}\PYG{l+m+mi}{3}\PYG{p}{;} \PYG{l+m+mi}{0}\PYG{p}{]}\PYG{p}{;} \PYG{c}{\PYGZpc{} bVec \PYGZhy{} vector in R\PYGZca{}2}
\PYG{c}{\PYGZpc{} affine transformation of ellipsoids in the second column of ellMat}
\PYG{n}{aTransMat} \PYG{p}{=} \PYG{n}{aMat} \PYG{o}{*} \PYG{n}{ellMat}\PYG{p}{(}\PYG{p}{:}\PYG{p}{,} \PYG{l+m+mi}{2}\PYG{p}{)} \PYG{o}{+} \PYG{n}{bVec}\PYG{p}{;}
\end{Verbatim}

Sometimes it may be useful to modify the shape of the ellipsoid without
affecting its center. Say, we would like to bloat or squeeze the
ellipsoid:

\begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\},numbers=left,firstnumber=1,stepnumber=1]
\PYG{n}{bltEllObj} \PYG{p}{=} \PYG{n}{firstEllObj}\PYG{p}{.}\PYG{n}{getShape}\PYG{p}{(}\PYG{l+m+mi}{2}\PYG{p}{)}\PYG{p}{;}  \PYG{c}{\PYGZpc{} bloats ellipsoid firstEllObj}
\PYG{n}{sqzEllObj} \PYG{p}{=} \PYG{n}{firstEllObj}\PYG{p}{.}\PYG{n}{getShape}\PYG{p}{(}\PYG{l+m+mf}{0.5}\PYG{p}{)}\PYG{p}{;}  \PYG{c}{\PYGZpc{} squeezes ellipsoid firstEllObj}
\end{Verbatim}

Since function shape does not change the center of the
ellipsoid, it only accepts scalars or square matrices as its second
input parameter. Several functions access the internal data of the
ellipsoid object:

\begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\},numbers=left,firstnumber=1,stepnumber=1]
\PYG{p}{[}\PYG{n}{centVec}\PYG{p}{,} \PYG{n}{shMat}\PYG{p}{]} \PYG{p}{=} \PYG{n}{secEllObj}\PYG{p}{.}\PYG{n}{double}\PYG{p}{(}\PYG{p}{)}
\PYG{c}{\PYGZpc{} centVec =}
\PYG{c}{\PYGZpc{} }
\PYG{c}{\PYGZpc{}    \PYGZhy{}0.5000}
\PYG{c}{\PYGZpc{}    \PYGZhy{}0.1667}
\PYG{c}{\PYGZpc{} }
\PYG{c}{\PYGZpc{} shMat =}
\PYG{c}{\PYGZpc{} }
\PYG{c}{\PYGZpc{}    0.9167     0.9167}
\PYG{c}{\PYGZpc{}    0.9167     1.5278}
\end{Verbatim}

\begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\},numbers=left,firstnumber=1,stepnumber=1]
\PYG{c}{\PYGZpc{} define new ellipsoid}
\PYG{n}{fourthEllObj} \PYG{p}{=} \PYG{n}{ellipsoid}\PYG{p}{(}\PYG{p}{[}\PYG{l+m+mi}{42} \PYG{o}{\PYGZhy{}}\PYG{l+m+mi}{7} \PYG{o}{\PYGZhy{}}\PYG{l+m+mi}{2} \PYG{l+m+mi}{4}\PYG{p}{;} \PYG{o}{\PYGZhy{}}\PYG{l+m+mi}{7} \PYG{l+m+mi}{10} \PYG{l+m+mi}{3} \PYG{l+m+mi}{1}\PYG{p}{;} \PYG{o}{\PYGZhy{}}\PYG{l+m+mi}{2} \PYG{l+m+mi}{3} \PYG{l+m+mi}{5} \PYG{o}{\PYGZhy{}}\PYG{l+m+mi}{2}\PYG{p}{;} \PYG{l+m+mi}{4} \PYG{l+m+mi}{1} \PYG{o}{\PYGZhy{}}\PYG{l+m+mi}{2} \PYG{l+m+mi}{2}\PYG{p}{]}\PYG{p}{)}\PYG{p}{;}  
\PYG{n}{bufEllVec} \PYG{p}{=} \PYG{p}{[}\PYG{n}{ellMat}\PYG{p}{(}\PYG{l+m+mi}{1}\PYG{p}{,} \PYG{p}{:}\PYG{p}{)} \PYG{n}{fourthEllObj}\PYG{p}{]}\PYG{p}{;}

\PYG{c}{\PYGZpc{} ans =}
\PYG{c}{\PYGZpc{} }
\PYG{c}{\PYGZpc{}      0     0     1}
\end{Verbatim}

\begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\},numbers=left,firstnumber=1,stepnumber=1]
\PYG{n}{bufEllVec} \PYG{p}{=} \PYG{p}{[}\PYG{n}{ellMat}\PYG{p}{(}\PYG{l+m+mi}{1}\PYG{p}{,} \PYG{p}{:}\PYG{p}{)} \PYG{n}{fourthEllObj}\PYG{p}{]}\PYG{p}{;}
\PYG{p}{[}\PYG{n}{dimVec}\PYG{p}{,} \PYG{n}{rankVec}\PYG{p}{]} \PYG{p}{=} \PYG{n}{bufEllVec}\PYG{p}{.}\PYG{n}{dimension}\PYG{p}{(}\PYG{p}{)} 


\PYG{c}{\PYGZpc{} dimVec =}
\PYG{c}{\PYGZpc{} }
\PYG{c}{\PYGZpc{}    2     2     4}
\PYG{c}{\PYGZpc{} }
\PYG{c}{\PYGZpc{} rankVec =}
\PYG{c}{\PYGZpc{} }
\PYG{c}{\PYGZpc{}    2     2     3}
\end{Verbatim}

One way to check if two ellipsoids intersect, is to
compute the distance between them ({\hyperref[chap_implement:stanhp]{{[}STANHP{]}}}, {\hyperref[chap_implement:lin2002]{{[}LIN2002{]}}}):

\begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\},numbers=left,firstnumber=1,stepnumber=1]
\PYG{c}{\PYGZpc{} distance between thirdEllObj and each of the ellipsoids in ellMat}
\PYG{n}{ellMat}\PYG{p}{.}\PYG{n}{distance}\PYG{p}{(}\PYG{n}{thirdEllObj}\PYG{p}{)} 

\PYG{c}{\PYGZpc{} ans =}
\PYG{c}{\PYGZpc{} }
\PYG{c}{\PYGZpc{}          0         0}
\PYG{c}{\PYGZpc{}          0    0.1683}
\end{Verbatim}

This result indicates that the ellipsoid
thirdEllObj does not intersect with the ellipsoid ellMat(2, 2), with all
the other ellipsoids in ellMat it has nonempty intersection. If the
intersection of the two ellipsoids is nonempty, it can be approximated
by ellipsoids from the outside as well as from the inside. See
{\hyperref[chap_ellcalc:ros2002]{{[}ROS2002{]}}}
for more information about these methods.

\begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\},numbers=left,firstnumber=1,stepnumber=1]
\PYG{c}{\PYGZpc{} external approximation of intersection of firstEllObj and thirdEllObj}
\PYG{n}{externalEllObj} \PYG{p}{=} \PYG{n}{firstEllObj}\PYG{p}{.}\PYG{n}{intersection\PYGZus{}ea}\PYG{p}{(}\PYG{n}{thirdEllObj}\PYG{p}{)}\PYG{p}{;}

\end{Verbatim}

It can be checked that
resulting ellipsoid externalEllObj contains the given intersection,
whereas internalEllObj is contained in this intersection:

\begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\},numbers=left,firstnumber=1,stepnumber=1]
\PYG{c}{\PYGZpc{} array [firstEllObj secEllObj] should be treated as intersection}
\PYG{n}{externalEllObj}\PYG{p}{.}\PYG{n}{doesIntersectionContain}\PYG{p}{(}\PYG{p}{[}\PYG{n}{firstEllObj} \PYG{n}{secEllObj}\PYG{p}{]}\PYG{p}{,} \PYG{l+s}{\PYGZsq{}}\PYG{l+s}{i\PYGZsq{}}\PYG{p}{)}  

\PYG{c}{\PYGZpc{} ans =}
\PYG{c}{\PYGZpc{} }
\PYG{c}{\PYGZpc{}      1}
\end{Verbatim}

\begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\},numbers=left,firstnumber=1,stepnumber=1]
\PYG{n}{bufEllVec} \PYG{p}{=} \PYG{p}{[}\PYG{n}{firstEllObj} \PYG{n}{thirdEllObj}\PYG{p}{]}
\PYG{n}{bufEllVec}\PYG{p}{.}\PYG{n}{doesIntersectionContain}\PYG{p}{(}\PYG{n}{internalEllObj}\PYG{p}{)} 

\PYG{c}{\PYGZpc{} ans =}
\PYG{c}{\PYGZpc{} }
\PYG{c}{\PYGZpc{}      1}
\end{Verbatim}

Function
isInside in general checks if the intersection of ellipsoids in the
given array contains the union or intersection of ellipsoids or
polytopes.

It is also possible to solve the feasibility problem, that is, to check
if the intersection of more than two ellipsoids is empty:

\begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\},numbers=left,firstnumber=1,stepnumber=1]
\PYG{n}{ellMat}\PYG{p}{.}\PYG{n}{intersect}\PYG{p}{(}\PYG{n}{ellMat}\PYG{p}{(}\PYG{l+m+mi}{1}\PYG{p}{,} \PYG{l+m+mi}{1}\PYG{p}{)}\PYG{p}{,} \PYG{l+s}{\PYGZsq{}}\PYG{l+s}{i\PYGZsq{}}\PYG{p}{)}  

\PYG{c}{\PYGZpc{} ans =}
\PYG{c}{\PYGZpc{} }
\PYG{c}{\PYGZpc{}      \PYGZhy{}1}
\end{Verbatim}

In this
particular example the result \(-1\) indicates that the intersection
of ellipsoids in ellMat is empty. Function intersect in general checks
if an ellipsoid, hyperplane or polytope intersects the union or the
intersection of ellipsoids in the given array:

\begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\},numbers=left,firstnumber=1,stepnumber=1]
\PYG{n}{bufEllVec} \PYG{p}{=} \PYG{p}{[}\PYG{n}{firstEllObj} \PYG{n}{secEllObj} \PYG{n}{thirdEllObj}\PYG{p}{]}
\PYG{n}{bufEllVec}\PYG{p}{.}\PYG{n}{intersect}\PYG{p}{(}\PYG{n}{ellMat}\PYG{p}{(}\PYG{l+m+mi}{2}\PYG{p}{,} \PYG{l+m+mi}{2}\PYG{p}{)}\PYG{p}{,} \PYG{l+s}{\PYGZsq{}}\PYG{l+s}{i\PYGZsq{}}\PYG{p}{)}

\PYG{c}{\PYGZpc{} ans =}
\PYG{c}{\PYGZpc{} }
\PYG{c}{\PYGZpc{}      0}
\end{Verbatim}

\begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\},numbers=left,firstnumber=1,stepnumber=1]
\PYG{n}{bufEllVec} \PYG{p}{=} \PYG{p}{[}\PYG{n}{firstEllObj} \PYG{n}{secEllObj} \PYG{n}{thirdEllObj}\PYG{p}{]}\PYG{p}{;}
\PYG{n}{bufEllVec}\PYG{p}{.}\PYG{n}{intersect}\PYG{p}{(}\PYG{n}{ellMat}\PYG{p}{(}\PYG{l+m+mi}{2}\PYG{p}{,} \PYG{l+m+mi}{2}\PYG{p}{)}\PYG{p}{,} \PYG{l+s}{\PYGZsq{}}\PYG{l+s}{u\PYGZsq{}}\PYG{p}{)}

\PYG{c}{\PYGZpc{} ans =}
\PYG{c}{\PYGZpc{} }
\PYG{c}{\PYGZpc{}      1}
\end{Verbatim}

For the ellipsoids in
\({\bf R}\), \({\bf R}^2\) and \({\bf R}^3\) the geometric
sum can be computed explicitely and plotted:

\begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\},numbers=left,firstnumber=1,stepnumber=1]
\PYG{n}{ellMat}\PYG{p}{.}\PYG{n}{minksum}\PYG{p}{(}\PYG{p}{)}\PYG{p}{;}

\hyperref[chap_implement:minksumpic]{Figure  \ref*{chap_implement:minksumpic}} displays the geometric sum of ellipsoids. If
the dimension of the space in which the ellipsoids are defined exceeds
\(3\), an error is returned. The result of the geometric sum
operation is not generally an ellipsoid, but it can be approximated by
families of external and internal ellipsoids parametrized by the

Functions minksum\_ea and minksum\_ia work for
ellipsoids of arbitrary dimension. They should be used for general
computations whereas minksum is there merely for visualization purposes.

If the geometric difference of two ellipsoids is not an empty set, it
can be computed explicitely and plotted for ellipsoids in
\({\bf R}\), \({\bf R}^2\) and \({\bf R}^3\):

\hyperref[chap_implement:minkdiffpic]{Figure  \ref*{chap_implement:minkdiffpic}} shows the geometric difference of ellipsoids.

Similar to minksum, minkdiff is there for visualization purpose. It
works only for dimensions \(1\), \(2\) and \(3\), and for
higher dimensions it returns an error. For arbitrary dimensions, the
geometric difference can be approximated by families of external and
internal ellipsoids parametrized by the direction vector, provided this
direction is not bad:

\section{Operations with hyperplanes}
\label{chap_implement:operations-with-hyperplanes}
The class hyperplane of the \emph{Ellipsoidal Toolbox} is used to describe
hyperplanes and halfspaces. The following two commands define one and
the same hyperplane but two different halfspaces:

\begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\},numbers=left,firstnumber=1,stepnumber=1]
\PYG{n}{firstHypObj} \PYG{p}{=} \PYG{n}{hyperplane}\PYG{p}{(}\PYG{p}{[}\PYG{l+m+mi}{1}\PYG{p}{;} \PYG{l+m+mi}{1}\PYG{p}{]}\PYG{p}{,} \PYG{l+m+mi}{1}\PYG{p}{)}\PYG{p}{;}  \PYG{c}{\PYGZpc{} defines halfspace x1 + x2 \PYGZlt{}= 1}
\PYG{n}{firstHypObj} \PYG{p}{=} \PYG{n}{hyperplane}\PYG{p}{(}\PYG{p}{[}\PYG{o}{\PYGZhy{}}\PYG{l+m+mi}{1}\PYG{p}{;} \PYG{o}{\PYGZhy{}}\PYG{l+m+mi}{1}\PYG{p}{]}\PYG{p}{,} \PYG{o}{\PYGZhy{}}\PYG{l+m+mi}{1}\PYG{p}{)}\PYG{p}{;}  \PYG{c}{\PYGZpc{} defines halfspace x1 + x2 \PYGZgt{}= 1}
\end{Verbatim}

The following functions and operators are overloaded for the hyperplane
class:
\begin{itemize}
\item {} 
isempty(hypObj) -- checks if hypObj is an empty hyperplane.

\item {} 
display(hypObj) -- displays the details of hyperplane
\(H(c,\gamma)\), namely, its normal \(c\) and the scalar
\(\gamma\).

\item {} 
plot(hypObj) -- plots hyperplane \(H(c,\gamma)\) if the dimension
of the space in which it is defined is not greater than 3.

\item {} 
firstHypObj == secHypObj -- checks if hyperplanes
\(H(c_1,\gamma_1)\) and \(H(c_2,\gamma_2)\) are equal.

\item {} 
firstHypObj = secHypObj -- checks if hyperplanes
\(H(c_1,\gamma_1)\) and \(H(c_2,\gamma_2)\) are not equal.

\item {} 
{[} , {]} -- concatenates the hyperplanes into the horizontal array, e.g. hypVec
= {[}firstHypObj secHypObj thirdHypObj{]}.

\item {} 
{[} ; {]} -- concatenates the hyperplanes into the vertical array, e.g. hypMat =
{[}firstHypObj secHypObj; thirdHypObj fourthHypObj{]} -- defines
\(2\times 2\) array of hyperplanes.

\item {} 
-hypObj -- defines hyperplane \(H(-c,-\gamma)\), which is the same
as \(H(c,\gamma)\) but specifies different halfspace.

\end{itemize}

There are several ways to access the internal data of the hyperplane
object:

\begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\},numbers=left,firstnumber=1,stepnumber=1]
\PYG{p}{[}\PYG{n}{normVec}\PYG{p}{,} \PYG{n}{hypScal}\PYG{p}{]} \PYG{p}{=} \PYG{n}{firstHypObj}\PYG{p}{.}\PYG{n}{double}\PYG{p}{(}\PYG{p}{)}

\PYG{n}{firstHypObj}\PYG{p}{.}\PYG{n}{isparallel}\PYG{p}{(}\PYG{n}{secHypObj}\PYG{p}{)} 

\PYG{c}{\PYGZpc{} ans =}
\PYG{c}{\PYGZpc{} }
\PYG{c}{\PYGZpc{}      1     0}
\end{Verbatim}

All the functions of \emph{Ellipsoidal Toolbox} that accept
hyperplane object as parameter, work with single hyperplanes as well as
with hyperplane arrays. One exception is the function parameters that
allows only single hyperplane object.

An array of hyperplanes can be converted to the polytope object of the
Multi-Parametric Toolbox ({\hyperref[chap_implement:kvas2004]{{[}KVAS2004{]}}}, {\hyperref[chap_install:mpthp]{{[}MPTHP{]}}}), and back:

\end{Verbatim}

Functions hyperplane2polytope and
polytope2hyperplane require the Multi-Parametric Toolbox to be
installed.

We can compute distance from ellipsoids to hyperplanes and polytopes:

\begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\},numbers=left,firstnumber=1,stepnumber=1]
\PYG{c}{\PYGZpc{} distance from ellipsoid firstEllObj to each of the hyperplanes in hypVec}
\PYG{n}{firstEllObj}\PYG{p}{.}\PYG{n}{distance}\PYG{p}{(}\PYG{n}{hypVec}\PYG{p}{)}  

\PYG{c}{\PYGZpc{} ans =}
\PYG{c}{\PYGZpc{} }
\PYG{c}{\PYGZpc{}      \PYGZhy{}0.5176    0.8966   \PYGZhy{}2.6841    0.1444}

\PYG{c}{\PYGZpc{} distance from each of the ellipsoids in ellMat to the polytope}
\PYG{c}{\PYGZpc{} firstPolObj}
\PYG{n}{ellMat}\PYG{p}{.}\PYG{n}{distance}\PYG{p}{(}\PYG{n}{firstPolObj}\PYG{p}{)}  

\PYG{c}{\PYGZpc{} ans =}
\PYG{c}{\PYGZpc{} }
\PYG{c}{\PYGZpc{}      0     0}
\PYG{c}{\PYGZpc{}      0     0}
\end{Verbatim}

A negative distance value in the case of ellipsoid and hyperplane means
that the ellipsoid intersects the hyperplane. As we see in this example,
ellipsoid firstEllObj intersects hyperplanes hypVec(1) and hypVec(3) and
has no common points with hypVec(2) and hypVec(4). When distance
function has a polytope as a parameter, it always returns nonnegative
values to be consistent with distance function of the Multi-Parametric
Toolbox. Here, the zero distance values mean that each ellipsoid in
ellMat has nonempty intersection with polytope firstPolObj.

It can be checked if the union or intersection of given ellipsoids
intersects given hyperplanes or polytopes:

\PYG{c}{\PYGZpc{} ans =}
\PYG{c}{\PYGZpc{} }
\PYG{c}{\PYGZpc{}      1}
\end{Verbatim}

The intersection of ellipsoid and hyperplane can be computed exactly:

\begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\},numbers=left,firstnumber=1,stepnumber=1]

\PYG{c}{\PYGZpc{}      1}
\PYG{c}{\PYGZpc{}      1}

hyperplane objects, which in this case define halfspaces and polytope

Functions distance, intersect, intersection\_ia and isInside use the CVX
interface ({\hyperref[chap_install:cvxhp]{{[}CVXHP{]}}}) to the external optimization package. The
default optimization package included in the distribution of the
\emph{Ellipsoidal Toolbox} is SeDuMi ({\hyperref[chap_install:stur1999]{{[}STUR1999{]}}}, {\hyperref[chap_install:sdmhp]{{[}SDMHP{]}}}).


\section{Operations with ellipsoidal tubes}
\label{chap_implement:section-label}\label{chap_implement:operations-with-ellipsoidal-tubes}
There are several classes in \emph{Ellipsoidal Toolbox} for operations with
ellipsoidal tubes. The class gras.ellapx.smartdb.rels.EllTube is used to
describe ellipsoidal tubes. The class
gras.ellapx.smartdb.rels.EllUnionTube is used to store tubes by the
instant of time:
\phantomsection\label{chap_implement:union-label}\phantomsection\label{chap_implement:equation-ellUnion}\begin{gather}
\begin{split}{\mathcal X}_{U}[t]=\bigcup \limits_{\tau\leqslant t}{\mathcal X}[\tau],\end{split}\label{chap_implement-ellUnion}
\end{gather}
where \({\mathcal X}[\tau]\) is single ellipsoidal tube. The class
gras.ellapx.smartdb.rels.EllTubeProj is used to describe the projection
of the ellipsoidal tubes onto time dependent subspaces.There are two
types of projection: static and dynamic. Also there is class
gras.ellapx.smartdb.rels.EllUnionTubeStaticProj for description of the
projection on static plane tubes by the instant of time. Next we provide
some examples of the operations with ellipsoidal tubes.

We may be
interested in the data about ellipsoidal tube in some particular time
interval, smaller than the one for which the ellipsoidal tube was
computed, say \(2\leqslant t\leqslant4\). This data can be extracted

\section{Reachability}
\label{chap_implement:reachability}
To compute the reach sets of the systems described in chapter 3, we
define few new classes in the \emph{Ellipsoidal Toolbox}: class
LinSysContinuous for the continuous-time system description, class
LinSysDiscrete for the discrete-time system description and classes
ReachContinuous\(\backslash\)ReachDiscrete for the reach set
data. We start by explaining how to define a system using
LinSysContinuous object. Also we can use LinSysFactory class for the
description of this system. Through it’s method create user can get
LinSysContinuous or LinSysDiscrete object. For example, description of
the system
\begin{gather}
\begin{split}\left[\begin{array}{cc}
\dot{x}_1\\
\dot{x}_2\end{array}\right] = \left[\begin{array}{cc}
0 & 1\\
0 & 0\end{array}\right]\left[\begin{array}{c}
x_1\\
x_2\end{array}\right] + \left[\begin{array}{c}
u_1(t)\\
u_2(t)\end{array}\right], ~~~ u(t)\in{\mathcal E}(p(t), P)\end{split}\notag
\end{gather}
with
\begin{gather}
\begin{split}p(t) = \left[\begin{array}{c}
\sin(t)\\
\cos(t)\end{array}\right], ~~~ P = \left[\begin{array}{cc}
9 & 0\\
0 & 2\end{array}\right],\end{split}\notag
\end{gather}
is done by the following sequence of commands:

\begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\},numbers=left,firstnumber=1,stepnumber=1]
\PYG{n}{aMat} \PYG{p}{=} \PYG{p}{[}\PYG{l+m+mi}{0} \PYG{l+m+mi}{1}\PYG{p}{;} \PYG{l+m+mi}{0} \PYG{l+m+mi}{0}\PYG{p}{]}\PYG{p}{;} \PYG{n}{bMat} \PYG{p}{=} \PYG{n+nb}{eye}\PYG{p}{(}\PYG{l+m+mi}{2}\PYG{p}{)}\PYG{p}{;}  \PYG{c}{\PYGZpc{} matrices A and B, B is identity}
\PYG{n}{SUBounds} \PYG{p}{=} \PYG{n}{struct}\PYG{p}{(}\PYG{p}{)}\PYG{p}{;}
\PYG{c}{\PYGZpc{} center of the ellipsoid depends on t}
\PYG{n}{SUBounds}\PYG{p}{.}\PYG{n}{center} \PYG{p}{=} \PYG{p}{\PYGZob{}}\PYG{l+s}{\PYGZsq{}}\PYG{l+s}{sin(t)\PYGZsq{}}\PYG{p}{;} \PYG{l+s}{\PYGZsq{}}\PYG{l+s}{cos(t)\PYGZsq{}}\PYG{p}{\PYGZcb{}}\PYG{p}{;}  
\PYG{n}{SUBounds}\PYG{p}{.}\PYG{n}{shape} \PYG{p}{=} \PYG{p}{[}\PYG{l+m+mi}{9} \PYG{l+m+mi}{0}\PYG{p}{;} \PYG{l+m+mi}{0} \PYG{l+m+mi}{2}\PYG{p}{]}\PYG{p}{;} \PYG{c}{\PYGZpc{} shape matrix of the ellipsoid is static}
\PYG{c}{\PYGZpc{} create linear system object}
\PYG{n}{sys} \PYG{p}{=} \PYG{n}{elltool}\PYG{p}{.}\PYG{n}{linsys}\PYG{p}{.}\PYG{n}{LinSysContinuous}\PYG{p}{(}\PYG{n}{aMat}\PYG{p}{,} \PYG{n}{bMat}\PYG{p}{,} \PYG{n}{SUBounds}\PYG{p}{)}\PYG{p}{;} 
\PYG{c}{\PYGZpc{} is equal to sys = elltool.linsys.LinSysFactory.create(aMat, bMat, SUBounds)}
\end{Verbatim}

If matrices \(A\) or
\(B\) depend on time, say \(A(t)=\left[\begin{array}{cc}
0 & 1-\cos(2t)\\
-\frac{1}{t} & 0\end{array}\right]\), then matrix aMat should be
symbolic:

\begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\},numbers=left,firstnumber=1,stepnumber=1]
\PYG{n}{atMat} \PYG{p}{=} \PYG{p}{\PYGZob{}}\PYG{l+s}{\PYGZsq{}}\PYG{l+s}{0\PYGZsq{}} \PYG{l+s}{\PYGZsq{}}\PYG{l+s}{1 \PYGZhy{} cos(2*t)\PYGZsq{}}\PYG{p}{;} \PYG{l+s}{\PYGZsq{}}\PYG{l+s}{\PYGZhy{}1/t\PYGZsq{}} \PYG{l+s}{\PYGZsq{}}\PYG{l+s}{0\PYGZsq{}}\PYG{p}{\PYGZcb{}}\PYG{p}{;}  
\PYG{n}{sys\PYGZus{}t} \PYG{p}{=} \PYG{n}{elltool}\PYG{p}{.}\PYG{n}{linsys}\PYG{p}{.}\PYG{n}{LinSysFactory}\PYG{p}{.}\PYG{n}{create}\PYG{p}{(}\PYG{n}{atMat}\PYG{p}{,} \PYG{n}{bMat}\PYG{p}{,} \PYG{n}{SUBounds}\PYG{p}{)}\PYG{p}{;}
\end{Verbatim}

To describe the system with disturbance
\begin{gather}
\begin{split}\left[\begin{array}{cc}
\dot{x}_1\\
\dot{x}_2\end{array}\right] = \left[\begin{array}{cc}
0 & 1\\
0 & 0\end{array}\right]\left[\begin{array}{c}
x_1\\
x_2\end{array}\right] + \left[\begin{array}{c}
u_1(t)\\
u_2(t)\end{array}\right] + \left[\begin{array}{c}
0\\
1\end{array}\right]v(t),\end{split}\notag
\end{gather}
with bounds on control as before, and disturbance being
\(-1\leqslant v(t)\leqslant1\), we type:

\begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\},numbers=left,firstnumber=1,stepnumber=1]
\PYG{n}{gMat} \PYG{p}{=} \PYG{p}{[}\PYG{l+m+mi}{0}\PYG{p}{;} \PYG{l+m+mi}{1}\PYG{p}{]}\PYG{p}{;}  \PYG{c}{\PYGZpc{} matrix G}
\PYG{n}{vEllObj} \PYG{p}{=} \PYG{n}{ellipsoid}\PYG{p}{(}\PYG{l+m+mi}{1}\PYG{p}{)}\PYG{p}{;}  \PYG{c}{\PYGZpc{} disturbance bounds: unit ball in R}
\PYG{n}{sys\PYGZus{}d} \PYG{p}{=} \PYG{n}{elltool}\PYG{p}{.}\PYG{n}{linsys}\PYG{p}{.}\PYG{n}{LinSysContinuous}\PYG{p}{(}\PYG{n}{aMat}\PYG{p}{,} \PYG{n}{bMat}\PYG{p}{,} \PYG{n}{SUBounds}\PYG{p}{,}\PYG{c}{...}
    \PYG{n}{gMat}\PYG{p}{,} \PYG{n}{vEllObj}\PYG{p}{)}\PYG{p}{;}
\end{Verbatim}

Control and disturbance
bounds SUBounds and vEllObj can have different types. If the bound is
constant, it should be described by ellipsoid object. If the bound
depends on time, then it is represented by a structure with fields
center and shape, one or both of which are symbolic. In system sys, the
control bound SUBounds is defined as such a structure. Finally, if the
control or disturbance is known and fixed, it should be defined as a
vector, of type double if constant, or symbolic, if it depends on time.

To declare a discrete-time system
\begin{gather}
\begin{split}\left[\begin{array}{c}
x_1[k+1]\\
x_2[k+1]\end{array}\right] = \left[\begin{array}{cc}
0 & 1\\
-1 & -0.5\end{array}\right]\left[\begin{array}{c}
x_1[k]\\
x_2[k]\end{array}\right] + \left[\begin{array}{c}
0\\
1\end{array}\right]u[k], ~~~ -1\leqslant u[k]\leqslant1,\end{split}\notag
\end{gather}
we use LinSysDiscrete constructor:

\begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\},numbers=left,firstnumber=1,stepnumber=1]
\PYG{n}{adMat} \PYG{p}{=} \PYG{p}{[}\PYG{l+m+mi}{0} \PYG{l+m+mi}{1}\PYG{p}{;} \PYG{o}{\PYGZhy{}}\PYG{l+m+mi}{1} \PYG{o}{\PYGZhy{}}\PYG{l+m+mf}{0.5}\PYG{p}{]}\PYG{p}{;} \PYG{n}{bdMat} \PYG{p}{=} \PYG{p}{[}\PYG{l+m+mi}{0}\PYG{p}{;} \PYG{l+m+mi}{1}\PYG{p}{]}\PYG{p}{;}  \PYG{c}{\PYGZpc{} matrices A and B}
\PYG{n}{udBoundsEllObj}  \PYG{p}{=} \PYG{n}{ellipsoid}\PYG{p}{(}\PYG{l+m+mi}{1}\PYG{p}{)}\PYG{p}{;}  \PYG{c}{\PYGZpc{} control bounds: unit ball in R}
\PYG{c}{\PYGZpc{} discrete\PYGZhy{}time system}
\PYG{n}{dtsys} \PYG{p}{=} \PYG{n}{elltool}\PYG{p}{.}\PYG{n}{linsys}\PYG{p}{.}\PYG{n}{LinSysDiscrete}\PYG{p}{(}\PYG{n}{adMat}\PYG{p}{,} \PYG{n}{bdMat}\PYG{p}{,} \PYG{n}{udBoundsEllObj}\PYG{p}{)}\PYG{p}{;} 
\PYG{c}{\PYGZpc{} is equal to dtsys = elltool.linsys.LinSysFactory.create(adMat, bdMat,...}
\PYG{c}{\PYGZpc{}         udBoundsEllObj,...[], [], [], [], \PYGZsq{}d\PYGZsq{}); }
\end{Verbatim}

Once the LinSysDiscrete object is
created, we need to specify the set of initial conditions, the time
interval and values of the direction vector, for which the reach set
approximations must be computed:

\begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\},numbers=left,firstnumber=1,stepnumber=1]
\PYG{n}{x0EllObj} \PYG{p}{=} \PYG{n}{ell\PYGZus{}unitball}\PYG{p}{(}\PYG{l+m+mi}{2}\PYG{p}{)}\PYG{p}{;}  \PYG{c}{\PYGZpc{} set of initial conditions}
\PYG{n}{timeVec} \PYG{p}{=} \PYG{p}{[}\PYG{l+m+mi}{0} \PYG{l+m+mi}{10}\PYG{p}{]}\PYG{p}{;}  \PYG{c}{\PYGZpc{} time interval}
\PYG{n}{dirsMat} \PYG{p}{=} \PYG{p}{[}\PYG{l+m+mi}{1} \PYG{l+m+mi}{0}\PYG{p}{;} \PYG{l+m+mi}{0} \PYG{l+m+mi}{1}\PYG{p}{]}\PYG{o}{\PYGZsq{}}\PYG{p}{;}  \PYG{c}{\PYGZpc{} columns of L specify the directions}
\end{Verbatim}

The reach set approximation is computed
by calling the constructor of the ReachContinuous object:

\begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\},numbers=left,firstnumber=1,stepnumber=1]
\PYG{c}{\PYGZpc{} reach set of continuos\PYGZhy{}time system}
\PYG{n}{firstRsObj} \PYG{p}{=} \PYG{n}{elltool}\PYG{p}{.}\PYG{n}{reach}\PYG{p}{.}\PYG{n}{ReachContinuous}\PYG{p}{(}\PYG{n}{sys}\PYG{p}{,} \PYG{n}{x0EllObj}\PYG{p}{,} \PYG{n}{dirsMat}\PYG{p}{,} \PYG{n}{timeVec}\PYG{p}{)}\PYG{p}{;}
\end{Verbatim}

At this point,
variable firstRsObj contains the reach set approximations for the
specified continuous-time system, time interval and set of initial
conditions computed for given directions. Both external and internal
approximations are computed. The reach set approximation data can be
extracted in the form of arrays of ellipsoids:

\begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\},numbers=left,firstnumber=1,stepnumber=1]
\PYG{n}{externallEllMat} \PYG{p}{=} \PYG{n}{firstRsObj}\PYG{p}{.}\PYG{n}{get\PYGZus{}ea}\PYG{p}{(}\PYG{p}{)}  \PYG{c}{\PYGZpc{} external approximating ellipsoids}

\PYG{c}{\PYGZpc{} externallEllMat =}
\PYG{c}{\PYGZpc{} Array of ellipsoids with dimensionality 2x100}

\PYG{c}{\PYGZpc{} internal approximating ellipsoids}
\PYG{p}{[}\PYG{n}{internalEllMat}\PYG{p}{,} \PYG{n}{timeVec}\PYG{p}{]} \PYG{p}{=} \PYG{n}{firstRsObj}\PYG{p}{.}\PYG{n}{get\PYGZus{}ia}\PYG{p}{(}\PYG{p}{)}\PYG{p}{;}
\end{Verbatim}

Ellipsoidal arrays externallEllMat and internalEllMat have \(4\)
rows because we computed the reach set approximations for \(4\)
directions. Each row of ellipsoids corresponds to one direction. The
number of columns in externallEllMat and internalEllMat is defined by
the nTimeGridPoints parameter, which is available from
elltool.conf.Properties static class (see chapter 6 for details). It
represents the number of time values in our time interval, at which the
approximations are evaluated. These time values are returned in the
optinal output parameter, array timeVec, whose length is the same as the
number of columns in externallEllMat and internalEllMat. Intersection of
ellipsoids in a particular column of externallEllMat gives external
ellipsoidal approximation of the reach set at corresponding time.
Internal ellipsoidal approximation of this set at this time is given by
the union of ellipsoids in the same column of internalEllMat.

We may be interested in the reachability data of our system in some
particular time interval, smaller than the one for which the reach set
was computed, say \(3\leqslant t\leqslant5\). This data can be
extracted and returned in the form of ReachContinuous object by the cut
function:

\begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\},numbers=left,firstnumber=1,stepnumber=1]
\PYG{n}{cutObj} \PYG{p}{=} \PYG{n}{firstRsObj}\PYG{p}{.}\PYG{n}{cut}\PYG{p}{(}\PYG{p}{[}\PYG{l+m+mi}{3} \PYG{l+m+mi}{5}\PYG{p}{]}\PYG{p}{)}\PYG{p}{;}  \PYG{c}{\PYGZpc{} reach set for the time interval [3, 5]}
\end{Verbatim}

To obtain a snap shot of the reach set at given time, the same function
cut is used:

\begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\},numbers=left,firstnumber=1,stepnumber=1]
\PYG{n}{cutObj} \PYG{p}{=} \PYG{n}{firstRsObj}\PYG{p}{.}\PYG{n}{cut}\PYG{p}{(}\PYG{l+m+mi}{5}\PYG{p}{)}\PYG{p}{;}  \PYG{c}{\PYGZpc{} reach set at time t = 5}
\end{Verbatim}

It can be checked if the external or internal reach set
approximation intersects with given ellipsoids, hyperplanes or
polytopes:

\begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\},numbers=left,firstnumber=1,stepnumber=1]
\PYG{n}{ellObj} \PYG{p}{=} \PYG{n}{ellipsoid}\PYG{p}{(}\PYG{p}{[}\PYG{o}{\PYGZhy{}}\PYG{l+m+mi}{17}\PYG{p}{;} \PYG{l+m+mi}{0}\PYG{p}{]}\PYG{p}{,} \PYG{p}{[}\PYG{l+m+mi}{4} \PYG{o}{\PYGZhy{}}\PYG{l+m+mi}{1}\PYG{p}{;} \PYG{o}{\PYGZhy{}}\PYG{l+m+mi}{1} \PYG{l+m+mi}{1}\PYG{p}{]}\PYG{p}{)}\PYG{p}{;}  \PYG{c}{\PYGZpc{} define ellipsoid}

If a given set intersects with the internal approximation of the reach
set, then this set intersects with the actual reach set. If the given
set does not intersect with external approximation, this set does not
intersect the actual reach set. There are situations, however, when the
given set intersects with the external approximation but does not
intersect with the internal one. In our example above, ellipsoid ellObj
is such a case: the quality of the approximation does not allow us to
determine whether or not ellObj intersects with the actual reach set. To
improve the quality of approximation, refine function should be used:

\begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\},numbers=left,firstnumber=1,stepnumber=1]
\PYG{c}{\PYGZpc{} define new directions, in this case one, but could be more}
\PYG{n}{newDirsMat} \PYG{p}{=} \PYG{p}{[}\PYG{l+m+mi}{1}\PYG{p}{;} \PYG{o}{\PYGZhy{}}\PYG{l+m+mi}{1}\PYG{p}{]}\PYG{p}{;}
\PYG{c}{\PYGZpc{} compute approximations for the new directions}
\PYG{n}{firstRsObj} \PYG{p}{=} \PYG{n}{firstRsObj}\PYG{p}{.}\PYG{n}{refine}\PYG{p}{(}\PYG{n}{newDirsMat}\PYG{p}{)}\PYG{p}{;}
\PYG{c}{\PYGZpc{} snap shot of the reach set at time t = 5}
\PYG{n}{cutObj} \PYG{p}{=} \PYG{n}{firstRsObj}\PYG{p}{.}\PYG{n}{cut}\PYG{p}{(}\PYG{l+m+mi}{5}\PYG{p}{)}\PYG{p}{;}
\PYG{c}{\PYGZpc{} check if ellObj intersects the internal approximation}
\PYG{n}{cutObj}\PYG{p}{.}\PYG{n}{intersect}\PYG{p}{(}\PYG{n}{ellObj}\PYG{p}{,} \PYG{l+s}{\PYGZsq{}}\PYG{l+s}{i\PYGZsq{}}\PYG{p}{)}  

\PYG{c}{\PYGZpc{} ans =}
\PYG{c}{\PYGZpc{} }
\PYG{c}{\PYGZpc{}      1}
\end{Verbatim}

Now we are sure that ellipsoid ellObj intersects with the actual reach
set. However, to use the refine function, the reach set object must
contain all calculated data, otherwise, an error is returned.

Having a reach set object resulting from the ReachContinuous, cut or
refine operations, we can obtain the trajectory of the center of the
reach set and the good curves along which the actual reach set is
touched by its ellipsoidal approximations:

\begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\},numbers=left,firstnumber=1,stepnumber=1]
\PYG{p}{[}\PYG{n}{ctrMat}\PYG{p}{,} \PYG{n}{ttVec}\PYG{p}{]} \PYG{p}{=} \PYG{n}{firstRsObj}\PYG{p}{.}\PYG{n}{get\PYGZus{}center}\PYG{p}{(}\PYG{p}{)}\PYG{p}{;} \PYG{c}{\PYGZpc{} trajectory of the center}
\PYG{n}{gcCVec} \PYG{p}{=} \PYG{n}{firstRsObj}\PYG{p}{.}\PYG{n}{get\PYGZus{}goodcurves}\PYG{p}{(}\PYG{p}{)}  \PYG{c}{\PYGZpc{} get good curves}

\PYG{c}{\PYGZpc{} gcCVec =}
\PYG{c}{\PYGZpc{} [2x100 double] [2x100 double] [2x100 double] }
\end{Verbatim}

Variable ctrMat here is a matrix whose columns are the points ofthe
reach set center trajectory evaluated at time values returned in the
array ttVec. Variable gcCMat contains \(4\) matrices each of which
corresponds to a good curve (columns of such matrix are points of the
good curve evaluated at time values in ttVec). The analytic expression
for the control driving the system along a good curve is given by
{\hyperref[chap_reach:uct-label]{\emph{formula}}}.

We computed the reach set up to time \(10\). It is possible to
continue the reach set computation for a longer time horizon using the
reach set data at time \(10\) as initial condition. It is also
possible that the dynamics and inputs of the system change at certain
time, and from that point on the system evolves according to the new
system of differential equations. For example, starting at time
\(10\), our reach set may evolve in time according to the
time-variant system sys\_t defined above. Switched systems are a special
case of this situation. To compute the further evolution in time of the
existing reach set, function evolve should be used:

\begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\},numbers=left,firstnumber=1,stepnumber=1]
\PYG{c}{\PYGZpc{} reach set from time 10 to 14 with the same dynamics}

Function evolve can
be viewed as an implementation of the semigroup property.

To compute the backward reach set for some specified target set, we
declare the time interval so that the terminating time comes first:

Reach set and backward reach set computation for discrete-time systems
and manipulations with the resulting reach set object are performed
using the same functions as for continuous-time systems:

\begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\},numbers=left,firstnumber=1,stepnumber=1]
\PYG{n}{timeVec} \PYG{p}{=} \PYG{p}{[}\PYG{l+m+mi}{0} \PYG{l+m+mi}{100}\PYG{p}{]}\PYG{p}{;}  \PYG{c}{\PYGZpc{} represents 100 time steps from 1 to 100}

\PYG{c}{\PYGZpc{} internalEllMat =}
\PYG{c}{\PYGZpc{} Array of ellipsoids with dimensionality 3x51}
\end{Verbatim}

Number of columns in the ellipsoidal arrays externalEllMat and
internalEllMat is \(51\) because the backward reach set is computed
for \(50\) time steps, and the first column of these arrays contains
\(3\) ellipsoids yEllObj - the terminating condition.

When dealing with discrete-time systems, all functions that accept time
or time interval as an input parameter, round the time values and treat
them as integers.


\section{Properties}
\label{chap_implement:properties}
Functions of the \emph{Ellipsoidal Toolbox} can be called with user-specified
values of certain global parameters. System of the parameters are
configured using xml files, which available from a set of command-line
utilities:

\begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\},numbers=left,firstnumber=1,stepnumber=1]
\PYG{n}{elltool}\PYG{p}{.}\PYG{n}{setconf}\PYG{p}{(}\PYG{l+s}{\PYGZsq{}}\PYG{l+s}{default\PYGZsq{}}\PYG{p}{)}\PYG{p}{;}
\end{Verbatim}

Here we list system parameters available from the ’default’
configuration:
\begin{enumerate}
\item {} 
version = ’1.4dev’ - current version of \emph{ET}.

\item {} 
isVerbose = false - makes all the calls to \emph{ET} routines silent, and
no information except errors is displayed.

\item {} 
absTol = 1e-7 - absolute tolerance.

\item {} 
relTol = 1e-5 - relative tolerance.

\item {} 
nTimeGridPoints = 200 - density of the time grid for the continuous
time reach set computation. This parameter directly affects the
number of ellipsoids to be stored in the
ReachContinuous\(\backslash\)ReachDiscrete object.

\item {} 
ODESolverName = ode45 - specifies the ODE solver for continuous time
reach set computation.

\item {} 
isODENormControl = ’on’ - switches on and off the norm control in the
ODE solver. When turned on, it slows down the computation, but
improves the accuracy.

\item {} 
isEnabledOdeSolverOptions = false - when set to false, calls the ODE
solver without any additional options like norm control. It makes the
computation faster but less accurate. Otherwise, it is assumed to be
true, and only in this case the previous option makes a difference.

\item {} 
nPlot2dPoints = 200 - the number of points used to plot a 2D
ellipsoid. This parameter also affects the quality of 2D reach tube
and reach set plots.

\item {} 
nPlot3dPoints = 200 - the number of points used to plot a 3D
ellipsoid. This parameter also affects the quality of 3D reach set
plots.

\end{enumerate}

Once the configuration is loaded, the system parameters are available
through elltool.conf.Properties. elltool.conf.Properties is a static
class, providing emulation of static properties for toolbox. It has two
function types: setters and getters. Using getters we obtain system
parameters.

\begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\},numbers=left,firstnumber=1,stepnumber=1]
\PYG{n}{elltool}\PYG{p}{.}\PYG{n}{conf}\PYG{p}{.}\PYG{n}{Properties}\PYG{p}{.}\PYG{n}{getAbsTol}\PYG{p}{(}\PYG{p}{)}
\PYG{c}{\PYGZpc{} ans =}
\PYG{c}{\PYGZpc{} }
\PYG{c}{\PYGZpc{}    1.0000e\PYGZhy{}07}

\PYG{n}{elltool}\PYG{p}{.}\PYG{n}{conf}\PYG{p}{.}\PYG{n}{Properties}\PYG{p}{.}\PYG{n}{getNPlot2dPoints}\PYG{p}{(}\PYG{p}{)}

\PYG{c}{\PYGZpc{} ans =}
\PYG{c}{\PYGZpc{} }
\PYG{c}{\PYGZpc{}    200}
\end{Verbatim}

Some of the parameters can be changed in run-time via
setters.

\begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\},numbers=left,firstnumber=1,stepnumber=1]
\PYG{n}{elltool}\PYG{p}{.}\PYG{n}{conf}\PYG{p}{.}\PYG{n}{Properties}\PYG{p}{.}\PYG{n}{setNTimeGridPoints}\PYG{p}{(}\PYG{l+m+mi}{250}\PYG{p}{)}\PYG{p}{;}
\end{Verbatim}


\section{Visualization}
\label{chap_implement:visualization}
\emph{Ellipsoidal Toolbox} has several plotting routines:
\begin{itemize}
\item {} 
ellipsoid/plot - plots one or more ellipsoids, or arrays of
ellipsoids, defined in \({\bf R}\), \({\bf R}^2\) or
\({\bf R}^3\).

\item {} 
ellipsoid/minksum - plots geometric sum of finite number of
ellipsoids defined in \({\bf R}\), \({\bf R}^2\) or
\({\bf R}^3\).

\item {} 
ellipsoid/minkdiff - plots geometric difference (if it is not an
empty set) of two ellipsoids defined in \({\bf R}\),
\({\bf R}^2\) or \({\bf R}^3\).

\item {} 
ellipsoid/minkmp - plots geometric (Minkowski) sum of the geometric
difference of two ellipsoids and the geometric sum of \(n\)
ellipsoids defined in \({\bf R}\), \({\bf R}^2\) or
\({\bf R}^3\).

\item {} 
ellipsoid/minkpm - plots geometric (Minkowski) difference of the
geometric sum of ellipsoids and a single ellipsoid defined in
\({\bf R}\), \({\bf R}^2\) or \({\bf R}^3\).

\item {} 
hyperplane/plot - plots one or more hyperplanes, or arrays of
hyperplanes, defined in \({\bf R}^2\) or \({\bf R}^3\).

\item {} 
reach/plot\_ea - plots external approximation of the reach set whose
dimension is \(2\) or \(3\).

\item {} 
reach/plot\_ia - plots internal approximation of the reach set whose
dimension is \(2\) or \(3\).

\end{itemize}

All these functions allow the user to specify the color of the plotted
objects, line width for 1D and 2D plots, and transparency level of the
3D objects. Hyperplanes are displayed as line segments in 2D and square
facets in 3D. In the hyperplane/plot method it is possible to specify
the center of the line segment or facet and its size.

Ellipsoids of dimensions higher than three must be projected onto a two-
or three-dimensional subspace before being plotted. This is done by
means of projection function:

\begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\},numbers=left,firstnumber=1,stepnumber=1]
\PYGZpc{} create two 4\PYGZhy{}dimensional ellipsoids:
firstEllObj = ellipsoid([14 \PYGZhy{}4 2 \PYGZhy{}5; \PYGZhy{}4 6 0 1; 2 0 6 \PYGZhy{}1; \PYGZhy{}5 1 \PYGZhy{}1 2]);
secEllObj = firstEllObj.getInv();

\PYGZpc{} specify 3\PYGZhy{}dimensional subspace by its basis:

\PYGZpc{} columns of basisMat must be orthogonal
basisMat = [1 0 0 0; 0 0 1 0; 0 1 0 1].\PYGZsq{}; 

\PYGZpc{} get 3\PYGZhy{}dimensional projections of firstEllObj and secEllObj:
bufEllVec = [firstEllObj secEllObj];
\PYGZpc{} array ellVec contains projections of firstEllObj and secEllObj
ellVec = bufEllVec.projection(basisMat)  

\PYGZpc{} ellVec =
\PYGZpc{} Array of ellipsoids with dimensionality 1x2

ellVec.plot();  \PYGZpc{} plot ellipsoids in ellVec
\end{Verbatim}

Since the operation of projection is linear, the projection of the
geometric sum of ellipsoids equals the geometric sum of the projected
ellipsoids. The same is true for the geometric difference of two
ellipsoids.

Function projection exists also for the
ReachContinuous\(\backslash\)ReachDiscrete objects:

\begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\},numbers=left,firstnumber=1,stepnumber=1]
aMat = [0 1 0 0; \PYGZhy{}1 0 1 0; 0 0 0 1; 0 0 \PYGZhy{}1 0];
bMat = [0; 0; 0; 1];
uBoundsEllObj = ellipsoid(1);
\PYGZpc{} 4\PYGZhy{}dimensional system
sys = elltool.linsys.LinSysFactory.create(aMat, bMat, uBoundsEllObj);
dirsMat  = [1 1 0 1; 0 \PYGZhy{}1 1 0; \PYGZhy{}1 1 1 1; 0 0 \PYGZhy{}1 1].\PYGZsq{}; \PYGZpc{} matrix of directions
\PYGZpc{} reach set from time 0 to 5
rsObj = elltool.reach.ReachContinuous(sys, ell\PYGZus{}unitball(4), dirsMat,...
    [0 5], \PYGZsq{}isRegEnabled\PYGZsq{}, true, \PYGZsq{}isJustCheck\PYGZsq{}, false, \PYGZsq{}regTol\PYGZsq{}, 1e\PYGZhy{}4);
basisMat = [1 0 0 1; 0 1 1 0].\PYGZsq{};  \PYGZpc{} basis of 2\PYGZhy{}dimensional subspace

\PYGZpc{} project reach set rs onto basis basisMat
psObj = rsObj.projection(basisMat);
psObj.plotByEa();  \PYGZpc{} plot external approximation
hold on;
psObj.plotByIa();  \PYGZpc{} plot internal approximation
\end{Verbatim}

The quality of the ellipsoid and reach set plots is controlled by the
parameters nPlot2dPoints and nPlot3dPoints, which are available from
getters of ellipsoid class.


\chapter{Examples}

\section{Ellipsoids vs. Polytopes}
\label{chap_examples:ellipsoids-vs-polytopes}
Depending on the particular dynamical system, certain methods of reach
set computation may be more suitable than others. Even for a simple
2-dimensional discrete-time linear time-invariant system, application of
ellipsoidal methods may be more effective than using polytopes.

Consider the system from chapter 1:
\begin{gather}
\begin{split}\left[\begin{array}{c}
x_1[k+1]\\
x_2[k+1]\end{array}\right] = \left[\begin{array}{cc}
\cos(1) & \sin(1)\\
-\sin(1) & \cos(1)\end{array}\right]\left[\begin{array}{c}
x_1[k]\\
x_2[k]\end{array}\right] + \left[\begin{array}{c}\
u_1[k]\\
u_2[k]\end{array}\right], ~~~ x[0]\in{\mathcal X}_0, ~~~ u[k]\in U, ~~~ k\geqslant0,\end{split}\notag
\end{gather}
where \({\mathcal X}_0\) is the set of initial conditions, and
\(U\) is the control set.
\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\capstart

\includegraphics[width=0.500\linewidth]{chapter06_section01_ellpoly.png}
\caption{Figure 1: Reach set computation performance comparison.}\label{chap_examples:ellpolyfig}\end{figure}

Let \({\mathcal X}_0\) and \(U\) be unit boxes in
\({\bf R}^2\), and compute the reach set using the polytope method
implemented in MPT {\hyperref[chap_install:mpthp]{{[}MPTHP{]}}}. With every
time step the number of vertices of the reach set polytope increases by
\(4\). The complexity of the convex hull computation increases
exponentially with number of vertices. In \hyperref[chap_examples:ellpolyfig]{figure  \ref*{chap_examples:ellpolyfig}}, the time
required to compute the reach set for different time steps using
polytopes is shown in red.

To compute the reach set of the system using \emph{Ellipsoidal Toolbox}, we
assume \({\mathcal X}_0\) and \(U\) to be unit balls in
\({\bf R}^2\), fix any number of initial direction values that
corresponds to the number of ellipsoidal approximations, and obtain
external and internal ellipsoidal approximations of the reach set:

\end{Verbatim}

In \hyperref[chap_examples:ellpolyfig]{figure  \ref*{chap_examples:ellpolyfig}}, the time required to compute both external and
internal ellipsoidal approximations, with \(32\) ellipsoids each,
for different number of time steps is shown in blue.

\hyperref[chap_examples:ellpolyfig]{Figure  \ref*{chap_examples:ellpolyfig}} illustrates the fact that the complexity of polytope
method grows exponentially with number of time steps, whereas the
complexity of ellipsoidal method grows linearly.


\section{System with Disturbance}
\label{chap_examples:system-with-disturbance}\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\capstart

\includegraphics[width=0.300\linewidth]{chapter06_section02_springmass.png}
\caption{Figure 2: Spring-mass system.}\label{chap_examples:springmassfig}\end{figure}

The mechanical system presented in \hyperref[chap_examples:springmassfig]{figure  \ref*{chap_examples:springmassfig}}, is described
by the following system of equations:
\phantomsection\label{chap_examples:equation-spmass1}\begin{gather}
\begin{split}m_1\ddot{x}_1+(k_1+k_2)x_1-k_2x_2 & = u_1,\end{split}\label{chap_examples-spmass1}
\end{gather}\phantomsection\label{chap_examples:equation-spmass2}\begin{gather}
\begin{split}m_2\ddot{x}_2-k_2x_1+(k_1+k_2)x_2 & = u_2 .\end{split}\label{chap_examples-spmass2}
\end{gather}
Here \(u_1\) and \(u_2\) are the forces applied to masses
\(m_1\) and \(m_2\), and we shall assume
\([u_1 ~~ u_2]^T\in{\mathcal E}(0,I)\). The initial conditions can
be taken as \(x_1(0)=0\), \(x_2(0)=2\). Defining
\(x_3=\dot{x}_1\) and \(x_4=\dot{x}_2\), we can rewrite
\eqref{chap_examples-spmass1}-\eqref{chap_examples-spmass2} as a linear system in standard form:
\phantomsection\label{chap_examples:equation-spmassls}\begin{gather}
\begin{split}\left[\begin{array}{c}
\dot{x}_1 \\
\dot{x}_2 \\
\dot{x}_3 \\
\dot{x}_4 \end{array}\right] = \left[\begin{array}{cccc}
0 & 0 & 1 & 0\\
0 & 0 & 0 & 1\\
-\frac{k_1+k_2}{m_1} & \frac{k_2}{m_1} & 0 & 0\\
\frac{k_2}{m_2} & -\frac{k_1+k_2}{m_2} & 0 & 0\end{array}\right]
\left[\begin{array}{c}
x_1 \\
x_2 \\
x_3 \\
x_4 \end{array}\right] + \left[\begin{array}{cc}
0 & 0\\
0 & 0\\
\frac{1}{m_1} & 0\\
0 & \frac{1}{m_2}\end{array}\right]\left[\begin{array}{c}
u_1\\
u_2\end{array}\right].\end{split}\label{chap_examples-spmassls}
\end{gather}
Now we can compute the reach set of system \eqref{chap_examples-spmass1}-\eqref{chap_examples-spmass2} for
given time by computing the reach set of the linear system \eqref{chap_examples-spmassls}
and taking its projection onto \((x_1, x_2)\) subspace.

\hyperref[chap_examples:mechreachfig]{Figure  \ref*{chap_examples:mechreachfig}} (a) shows the reach set of the system
\eqref{chap_examples-spmass1}-\eqref{chap_examples-spmass2} evolving in time from \(t=0\) to \(t=4\).
\hyperref[chap_examples:mechreachfig]{Figure  \ref*{chap_examples:mechreachfig}} (b) presents a snapshot of this reach set at time
\(t=4\).

So far we considered an ideal system without any disturbance, such as
friction. We introduce disturbance to \eqref{chap_examples-spmass1}-\eqref{chap_examples-spmass2} by adding
extra terms, \(v_1\) and \(v_2\),
\phantomsection\label{chap_examples:equation-smdist1}\begin{gather}
\begin{split}m_1\ddot{x}_1+(k_1+k_2)x_1-k_2x_2 & = u_1 + v_1,\end{split}\label{chap_examples-smdist1}
\end{gather}\phantomsection\label{chap_examples:equation-smdist2}\begin{gather}
\begin{split}m_2\ddot{x}_2-k_2x_1+(k_1+k_2)x_2 & = u_2 + v_2,\end{split}\label{chap_examples-smdist2}
\end{gather}
which results in equation \eqref{chap_examples-spmassls} getting an extra term
\begin{gather}
\begin{split}\left[\begin{array}{cc}
0 & 0\\
0 & 0\\
1 & 0\\
0 & 1\end{array}\right]\left[\begin{array}{c}
v_1\\
v_2\end{array}\right].\end{split}\notag
\end{gather}
Assuming that \([v_1 ~~ v_2]^T\) is unknown but bounded by
ellipsoid \({\mathcal E}(0, \frac{1}{4}I)\), we can compute the
closed-loop reach set of the system with disturbance.

\caption{Figure 4: RLC circuit with two inputs.}\label{chap_examples:rlcfig}\end{figure}

By \emph{switched systems} we mean systems whose dynamics changes at known
times. Consider the RLC circuit shown in \hyperref[chap_examples:rlcfig]{figure  \ref*{chap_examples:rlcfig}}. It has two
inputs - the voltage (\(v\)) and current (\(i\)) sources. Define
\begin{itemize}
\item {} 
\(x_1\) - voltage across capacitor \(C_1\), so
\(C_1\dot{x}_1\) is the corresponding current;

\item {} 
\(x_2\) - voltage across capacitor \(C_2\), so the
corresponding current is \(C_2\dot{x}_2\).

\item {} 
\(x_3\) - current through the inductor \(L\), so the voltage
across the inductor is \(L\dot{x}_3\).

\end{itemize}

Applying Kirchoff current and voltage laws we arrive at the linear
system,
\phantomsection\label{chap_examples:equation-rlceq}\begin{gather}
\begin{split}\left[\begin{array}{c}
\dot{x}_1\\
\dot{x}_2\\
\dot{x}_3\end{array}\right] = \left[\begin{array}{ccc}
-\frac{1}{R_1C_1} & 0 & -\frac{1}{C_1}\\
0 & 0 & \frac{1}{C_2}\\
\frac{1}{L} & -\frac{1}{L} & -\frac{R_2}{L}\end{array}\right]
\left[\begin{array}{c}
x_1\\
x_2\\
x_3\end{array}\right] + \left[\begin{array}{cc}
\frac{1}{R_1C_1} & \frac{1}{C_1}\\
0 & 0\\
0 & 0\end{array}\right]\left[\begin{array}{c}
v\\
i\end{array}\right].\end{split}\label{chap_examples-rlceq}
\end{gather}
The parameters \(R_1\), \(R_2\), \(C_1\), \(C_2\) and
\(L\), as well as the inputs, may depend on time. Suppose, for time
\(0\leqslant t<2\), \(R_1=2\) Ohm, \(R_2=1\) Ohm,
\(C_1=3\) F, \(C_2=7\) F, \(L=2\) H, both inputs, \(v\)
and \(i\) are present and bounded by ellipsoid
\({\mathcal E}(0,I)\); and for time \(t\geqslant2\),
\(R_1=R_2=2\) Ohm, \(C_1=C_2=3\) F, \(L=6\) H, the current
source is turned off, and \(|v|\leqslant1\). Then, system \eqref{chap_examples-rlceq}
can be rewritten as
\phantomsection\label{chap_examples:equation-rlceq2}\begin{gather}
\begin{split}\left[\begin{array}{c}
\dot{x}_1\\
\dot{x}_2\\
\dot{x}_3\end{array}\right] = \left\{\begin{array}{ll}
\left[\begin{array}{ccc}
-\frac{1}{6} & 0 & -\frac{1}{3}\\
0 & 0 & \frac{1}{7}\\
\frac{1}{2} & -\frac{1}{2} & -\frac{1}{2}\end{array}\right]
\left[\begin{array}{c}
x_1\\
x_2\\
x_3\end{array}\right] + \left[\begin{array}{cc}
\frac{1}{6} & \frac{1}{3}\\
0 & 0\\
0 & 0\end{array}\right]\left[\begin{array}{c}
v\\
i\end{array}\right], & 0\leqslant t< 2, \\
\left[\begin{array}{ccc}
-\frac{1}{6} & 0 & -\frac{1}{3}\\
0 & 0 & \frac{1}{3}\\
\frac{1}{6} & -\frac{1}{6} & -\frac{1}{3}\end{array}\right]
\left[\begin{array}{c}
x_1\\
x_2\\
x_3\end{array}\right] + \left[\begin{array}{c}
\frac{1}{6} \\
0 \\
0 \end{array}\right]v, & 2\leqslant t. \end{array}\right.\end{split}\label{chap_examples-rlceq2}
\end{gather}
We can compute the reach set of \eqref{chap_examples-rlceq2} for some time \(t>2\),
say, \(t=3\).

(external and internal approximations).}\label{chap_examples:rlcreachfig}\end{figure}

\hyperref[chap_examples:rlcreachfig]{Figure  \ref*{chap_examples:rlcreachfig}} (a) shows how the reach set projection onto
\((x_1, x_2)\) of system \eqref{chap_examples-rlceq2} evolves in time from \(t=0\)
to \(t=3\). The external reach set approximation for the first
dynamics is in red, the internal approximation is in green. The dynamics
switches at \(t=2\). The external reach set approximation for the
second dynamics is in yellow, its internal approximation is in blue. The
full three-dimensional external (yellow) and internal (blue)
approximations of the reach set are shown in \hyperref[chap_examples:rlcreachfig]{figure  \ref*{chap_examples:rlcreachfig}} (b).

To find out where the system should start at time \(t=0\) in order
to reach a neighborhood M of the origin at time \(t=3\), we compute
the backward reach set from \(t=3\) to \(t=0\).

\section{Hybrid System}
\label{chap_examples:hybrid-system}\begin{figure}[htbp]

\caption{Figure 6: Highway model. Adapted from {\hyperref[chap_examples:sun2003]{{[}SUN2003{]}}}.}\label{chap_examples:hwfig}\end{figure}

There is no explicit implementation of the reachability analysis for
hybrid systems in the \emph{Ellipsoidal Toolbox}. Nonetheless, the operations
of intersection available in the toolbox allow us to work with certain
class of hybrid systems, namely, hybrid systems with affine continuous
dynamics whose guards are ellipsoids, hyperplanes, halfspaces or
polytopes.

We consider the \emph{switching-mode model} of highway traffic presented in
{\hyperref[chap_examples:sun2003]{{[}SUN2003{]}}}. The highway segment is divided into \(N\)
cells as shown in \hyperref[chap_examples:hwfig]{figure  \ref*{chap_examples:hwfig}}. In this particular case, \(N=4\).
The traffic density in cell \(i\) is \(x_i\) vehicles per mile,
\(i=1,2,3,4\).

Define
\begin{itemize}
\item {} 
\(v_i\) - average speed in mph, in the \(i\)-th cell,
\(i=1,2,3,4\);

\item {} 
\(w_i\) - backward congestion wave propagation speed in mph, in
the \(i\)-th highway cell, \(i=1,2,3,4\);

\item {} 
\(x_{Mi}\) - maximum allowed density in the \(i\)-th cell;
when this velue is reached, there is a traffic jam,
\(i=1,2,3,4\);

\item {} 
\(d_i\) - length of \(i\)-th cell in miles,
\(i=1,2,3,4\);

\item {} 
\(T_s\) - sampling time in hours;

\item {} 
\(b\) - split ratio for the off-ramp;

\item {} 
\(u_1\) - traffic flow coming into the highway segment, in
vehicles per hour (vph);

\item {} 
\(u_2\) - traffic flow coming out of the highway segment (vph);

\item {} 
\(u_3\) - on-ramp traffic flow (vph).

\end{itemize}

Highway traffic operates in two modes: \emph{free-flow} in normal operation;
and \emph{congested} mode, when there is a jam. Traffic flow in free-flow
mode is described by

The switch from the free-flow to the congested mode occurs when the
density \(x_2\) reaches \(x_{M2}\). In other words, the
hyperplane \(H([0 ~ 1 ~ 0 ~ 0]^T, x_{M2})\) is the guard.

We indicate how to implement the reach set computation of this hybrid
system. We first define the two linear systems and the guard.

We assume that initially the system is in free-flow mode. Given a set of

\eqref{chap_examples-fflow} for certain number of time steps. We will consider the

Analyzing the values in array dVec, we conclude that the free-flow reach
set has nonempty intersection with hyperplane grdHyp at \(t=18\) for
the first time, and at \(t=68\) for the last time. Between
\(t=18\) and \(t=68\) it crosses the guard. \hyperref[chap_examples:hwreachfig]{Figure  \ref*{chap_examples:hwreachfig}} (a)
shows the free-flow reach set projection onto
\((x_1,x_2,x_3)\) subspace for \(t=10\), before the guard
crossing; \hyperref[chap_examples:hwreachfig]{figure  \ref*{chap_examples:hwreachfig}} (b) for \(t=50\), during the guard
crossing; and \hyperref[chap_examples:hwreachfig]{figure  \ref*{chap_examples:hwreachfig}} (c) for \(t=80\), after the guard
was crossed.

For each time step that the intersection of the free-flow reach set and
the guard is nonempty, we establish a new initial time and a set of
initial conditions for the reach set computation according to dynamics
\eqref{chap_examples-cflow}. The initial time is the array index minus one, and the set of
initial conditions is the intersection of the free-flow reach set with
the guard.

The union of reach sets in array crs forms the reach set for the
congested dynamics.

A summary of the reach set computation of the linear hybrid system
\eqref{chap_examples-fflow}-\eqref{chap_examples-cflow} for \(N=100\) time steps with one guard crossing
is given in \hyperref[chap_examples:hwreachfig]{figure  \ref*{chap_examples:hwreachfig}} (d), which shows the projection of the
reach set trace onto \((x_1,x_2)\) subspace. The system starts
evolving in time in free-flow mode from a set of initial conditions at
\(t=0\), whose boundary is shown in magenta. The free-flow reach set
evolving from \(t=0\) to \(t=100\) is shown in blue. Between
\(t=18\) and \(t=68\) the free-flow reach set crosses the guard.
The guard is shown in red. For each nonempty intersection of the
free-flow reach set and the guard, the congested mode reach set starts
evolving in time until \(t=100\). All the congested mode reach sets
are shown in green. Observe that in the congested mode, the density
\(x_2\) in the congested part decreases slightly, while the density
\(x_1\) upstream of the congested part increases. The blue set above
the guard is not actually reached, because the state evolves according
to the green region.


\chapter{Ellipsoid tubes, tubes by instant of time and their projections}
\label{chap_ellTube::doc}\label{chap_ellTube:ellipsoid-tubes-tubes-by-instant-of-time-and-their-projections}
\textbf{Definition.} For any regularization matrix \(M(\cdot)\) the quadratically regularized alternated reach set of system with uncertainty is
\begin{gather}
\begin{split}{\mathcal X}^{q}_{U}(t,t_0,{\mathcal X}^{0},M(\cdot)) =
\underset{t_0\leq\tau\leq t}{\bigcup}{\mathcal X}^{q}_{U}(\tau,t_0,{\mathcal X}^{0},M   (\cdot)).\end{split}\notag
\end{gather}
Note that if system doesn't have uncertainty then \(M(\cdot)=0\).

By \({\mathcal E}(\overline{x}(t),X_{+}(t,l))\) and \({\mathcal E}(\overline{x}(t),X_{-}(t,l))\) denote tight external and internal approximations along \(l(\cdot)\) good direction such as \(l(t_0)=l\). Then the reach set by instant of time can be described as
\begin{gather}
\begin{split}{\mathcal X}^{q}_{U}[t]=\underset{\tau}{\bigcup}\underset{l}{\bigcap}\{
{\mathcal E}(\overline{x}(\tau),X_{+}(\tau,l)) |l\in {\mathcal S}_1(0),   \tau\leq t\}\subseteq\underset{l} {\bigcap}\{{\mathcal E}^{U}_{+}[t,l])    |l\in {\mathcal S}_1(0)\},\end{split}\notag
\end{gather}
where \({\mathcal E}^{U}_{+}[t,l]=\underset{\tau}{\bigcup}\{{\mathcal E}(\overline{x}(\tau),X_{+}(\tau,l))|t_0\leq\tau\leq t\}\) is the external ellipsoidal tube by instant of time.

Similar approxiamtion can be calculated with the internal ellipsoidal tube by instant of time \({\mathcal E}^{U}_{-}[t,l]=\underset{\tau}{\bigcup}\{{\mathcal E}(\overline{x}(\tau),X_{-}(\tau,l))|t_0\leq\tau\leq t\}\):
\begin{gather}
\begin{split}{\mathcal X}^{U}[t]\supseteq\underset{l}{\bigcup}\{{\mathcal E}^{U}_{-}[t,l]) |l\in {\mathcal S}_1(0)\}.\end{split}\notag
\end{gather}
Note that in general case ellipsoidal tube \({\mathcal E}^{U}_{+}[t,l]\) is not tight approximation. For more information see {\hyperref[chap_ellTube:gag2012]{{[}GAG2012{]}}}.

So, all in all, there are two types of ellipsoid tube objects that we can work with using \emph{Ellipsoidal Toolbox}:
\begin{itemize}
\item {} 
ellipsoidal tubes that are described in \emph{gras.ellapx.smartdb.rels.EllTube} class;

\item {} 
tubes by instant of time described in \emph{gras.ellapx.smartdb.rels.EllUnionTube} class
(see {\hyperref[chap_implement:union-label]{\emph{formula}}}).

\end{itemize}

These two type of objects can be projected on specified subspaces. The projections of ellipsoid tubes can be either static or dynamic. The are described in gras.ellapx.smartdb.rels.EllTubeProj class. As for the tubes by  instant of time, they can only be projected on static subspaces. These projections are described in gras.ellapx.smartdb.rels.EllUnionTubeStaticProj class. For more information about these types of projections and their differences and for examples see this {\hyperref[chap_implement:section-label]{\emph{link}}}.


\section{Ellipsoid tubes}
\label{chap_ellTube:ellipsoid-tubes}
There is a whole variety of operations upon ellipsoid tubes in \emph{Ellipsoidal Toolbox}. We can, of course, create them. When the ellipsoid tube object is created, we can cut them, concatenate, interpolate, plot and project them and so on.

The instruments to create ellipsoid tube objects are several functions:
\begin{itemize}
\item {} 
\emph{fromQArrays} method creates nEllTubes ellipsoid tube objects using an array of ellipsoid matrices and an array of ellipsoid centers specified at any point of time from timeVec;

\item {} 
\emph{fromQMArrays} method acts the same way as \emph{fromQArrays} method, except for this one requires to specify an array of regularization marices specified at any point of time from timeVec;

\item {} 
\emph{fromQMScaledArrays} method acts the same way as \emph{fromQMArrays} method, except for this one requires to also specify a vector of scale factors specified for every created ellipsoid tube;

\item {} 
\emph{fromEllArray} method creates ellipsoid tube object using an array of ellipsoids;

\item {} 
\emph{fromEllMArray} method creates ellipsoid tube object using an array of ellipsoids and an array of regularisation matrices.

\end{itemize}

Basically we can divide these methods into two groups, based od what objects they are using to create ellipsoid tube: an array of ellipsoid matrices with an array of ellipsoid centers (by using these methods we can create an ellipsoid tube object containing several ellipsoid tubes) or an array of ellipsoids (by using these methods we can create an ellipsoid tube object containing one ellipsoid tube). To illustrate the usage of these methods we have to describe several functions, that will be used in the process. Below are their descriptions.

Using the three above mentioned functions we can describe an examples of \emph{fromQArrays}, \emph{fromQMArrays} and \emph{fromQMScaledArrays} methods' usage.

To use \emph{fromEllArray} and \emph{fromEllMArray} methods we nave to describe one more auxiliary function (as these methods create an ellipsoid tube object containing only one ellipsoid tube and we can not use \emph{getData} function, because it returns data for crating random number of ellipsoid tubes).

Now we can write examples of these methods' usage.

As we can see in all these examples, we can specify how many ellipsoid tubes we want to create, which type of arrpoximation to use. Also we can create ellipsoid tube objects, which will contain several ellipsoid tubes with different types of approximation.

After creation of ellipsoid tube objects we can do several operations with them. Below is the \emph{getEllTube} function that create an ellipsoid tube object containing one or several ellipsoid tubes with specified type of approximation, on specified time vector with specified time points. This function will be used further down to illustrate other methods that we can use while working with ellipsoid tube objects.

As we have created an ellipsoid tube object, we can get all the types of differet data about it. There is a set of methods that can give information about the data stored in the object and give access to it.

Also we can copy the object, clear all the data, save it in a file:

As we have created the object, we can work with it. Below is the example of concatenating ellipsoid tube objects. We can concatenate objects containing one or several ellipsoid tubes with the same type of approximation.

As we can concatenate ellipsoid tubes, it is logical to be possible to cut ellipsoid tubes, leaving only part of it at specified vector of time or point of time. Below are the exmples:

After cutting, we can interpolate the resulting tube, using new time vector. Take notice that we have to make sure that the first and the last elements in old and new vectors of time are the same.

After that we can thin out the new ellipsoid tube, removing ellipsoids at sertain points of time.

Then we can also calculate new scale factor for specified fields:

Also we can compare objects using method \emph{isEqual}.

At last there are several methods for projecting ellipsoid tubes on the specified spaces. The first method projects the ellipsoid tube on specified space creating the specified type of projection.

The second method projects the ellipsoid tube onto subspace defined by vectors of standart basis with indices specified in indVec.

Also there is a method for calculating only static projections.

For creating the projection matrix a special function is used in all of these examples.


\section{Tubes by instant of time}
\label{chap_ellTube:tubes-by-instant-of-time}
As with ellipsoid tube objects, there are several methods that we can use while working with tubes by instant of time. First of all we can create tubes by instant of time using \emph{fromEllTubes} method:

From here on we will use the \emph{getUnion} function so we can get a tube by instant of time and work with it further on. As we have created a tubes by instant of time object, we can get all the types of differet data about it. There is a set of methods that can give information about the data stored in the object and give access to it.

Also we can copy the object, clear all the data, save it in a file.

Also we can compare tubes by instant of time using \emph{isEqual} method.

At last, as it has already been said tubes by instant of time can be projected only on static subspaces. It can be done in two ways.

As for ellipsoid tube projections, a special function is used to create the projection matrix for tubes by instant of time:


\section{Projections of ellipsoid tubes and tubes by instant of time}
\label{chap_ellTube:projections-of-ellipsoid-tubes-and-tubes-by-instant-of-time}
As it has already been said we can create either static or dynamic projections for ellipsoid tubes and only static projections for tubes by instant of time. There are several methods in \emph{Ellipsoidal Toolbox} for that. Most of them has already been described:
\begin{itemize}
\item {} 
\emph{project}, \emph{projectStatic} and \emph{projectToOrths} for ellipsoid tubes;

\item {} 
\emph{project} and \emph{projectStatic} for tubes by instant of time.

\end{itemize}

It should be mentioned that from here on all the examples are written for ellipsoid tube projections, but their usage is the same for the projections of tubes by instant of time. We wiil use \emph{getProj} function to create ellipsoid tube projection that we will work with.

As with ellipsoid tubes and tubes by instant of time we can get all the types of differet data about projections. There is a set of methods that can give information about the data stored in the object and give access to it.

Also we can copy the object, clear all the data, save it in a file.

Also we can compare ellipsoid tube projections using \emph{isEqual} method.

And finally we can plot out results using one of three methods: \emph{plot}, \emph{plotExt} (for external approximation) or \emph{plotInt} (for internal approximation).

All the three methods have several properties connected to the properties of the image, for example: transparency, color, line width and so on.

To read more about the differences of these projections {\hyperref[chap_implement:goto-label]{\emph{goto}}}. Also there you can find some illustrations for both ellTube projections and ellUnionTube projections.


\chapter{Summary and Outlook}
\label{chap_summary::doc}\label{chap_summary:summary-and-outlook}
Although some of the operations with ellipsoids are present in the
commercial Geometric Bounding Toolbox ({\hyperref[chap_summary:ver2001]{{[}VER2001{]}}}, {\hyperref[chap_summary:geomhp]{{[}GEOMHP{]}}}),
the ellipsoid-related functionality of that
toolbox is rather limited.

\emph{Ellipsoidal Toolbox} is the first free MATLAB package that implements
ellipsoidal calculus and uses ellipsoidal methods for reachability
analysis of continuous- and discrete-time affine systems,
continuous-time linear systems with disturbances and switched systems,
whose dynamics changes at known times. The reach set computation for
hybrid systems whose guards are hyperplanes or polyhedra is not
implemented explicitly, but the tool for such computation exists,
namely, the operations of intersection of ellipsoid with hyperplane and
ellipsoid with halfspace.

      secEllArr lies inside the intersection of ellipsoids in
      fstEllArr. Ellipsoids in fstEllArr and secEllArr must be

  res = DOESINTERSECTIONCONTAIN(fstEllArr, secPolyArr, mode)

  To check if the union of ellipsoids secEllArr belongs to the
  intersection of ellipsoids fstEllArr, it is enough to check that
  every ellipsoid of secEllMat is contained in every
  ellipsoid of fstEllArr.
  Checking if the intersection of ellipsoids in secEllMat is inside
  intersection fstEllMat can be formulated as quadratically
  constrained quadratic programming (QCQP) problem.

  Let fstEllArr(iEll) = E(q, Q) be an ellipsoid with center q and shape
  matrix Q. To check if this ellipsoid contains the intersection of
  ellipsoids in secObjArr:
  E(q1, Q1), E(q2, Q2), ..., E(qn, Qn), we define the QCQP problem:
                    J(x) = \PYGZlt{}(x \PYGZhy{} q), Q\PYGZca{}(\PYGZhy{}1)(x \PYGZhy{} q)\PYGZgt{} \PYGZhy{}\PYGZhy{}\PYGZgt{} max
  with constraints:
                    \PYGZlt{}(x \PYGZhy{} q1), Q1\PYGZca{}(\PYGZhy{}1)(x \PYGZhy{} q1)\PYGZgt{} \PYGZlt{}= 1   (1)
                    \PYGZlt{}(x \PYGZhy{} q2), Q2\PYGZca{}(\PYGZhy{}1)(x \PYGZhy{} q2)\PYGZgt{} \PYGZlt{}= 1   (2)

  If this problem is feasible, i.e. inequalities (1)\PYGZhy{}(n) do not
  contradict, or, in other words, intersection of ellipsoids
  E(q1, Q1), E(q2, Q2), ..., E(qn, Qn) is nonempty, then we can find
  vector y such that it satisfies inequalities (1)\PYGZhy{}(n)
  and maximizes function J. If J(y) \PYGZlt{}= 1, then ellipsoid E(q, Q)
  contains the given intersection, otherwise, it does not.

  The intersection of polyhedrons is a Polyhedron, which is computed
  by the standard routine of MPT. How checked if intersection of
  ellipsoids contains Polyhedron is explained in doesContainPoly.

  Checking if the union of polyhedrons belongs to the intersection
  of ellipsoids is the same as checking if its convex hull belongs
  to this intersection.

Input:
  regular:
      fstEllArr: ellipsoid [nDims1,nDims2,...,nDimsN] \PYGZhy{} array of ellipsoids
          of the same size.

          Polyhedron [nDims1,nDims2,...,nDimsN] \PYGZhy{} array of ellipsoids or
          polyhedrons of the same sizes.

          note: if mode == \PYGZsq{}i\PYGZsq{}, then fstEllArr, secEllVec should be
              array.

  properties:
      mode: char[1, 1] \PYGZhy{} \PYGZsq{}u\PYGZsq{} or \PYGZsq{}i\PYGZsq{}, go to description.
      computeMode: char[1,] \PYGZhy{} \PYGZsq{}highDimFast\PYGZsq{} or \PYGZsq{}lowDimFast\PYGZsq{}. Determines,
          which way function is computed, when secObjArr is Polyhedron. If
          secObjArr is ellipsoid computeMode is ignored. \PYGZsq{}highDimFast\PYGZsq{}
          works  faster for  high dimensions, \PYGZsq{}lowDimFast\PYGZsq{} for low. If
          this property is omitted if dimension of ellipsoids is greater
          then 10, then \PYGZsq{}hightDimFast\PYGZsq{} is choosen, otherwise \PYGZhy{}
          \PYGZsq{}lowDimFast\PYGZsq{}


Output:

      \PYGZhy{}1 \PYGZhy{} problem is infeasible, for example, if s = \PYGZsq{}i\PYGZsq{},

\subsection{ellipsoid.intersect}
\label{chap_functions:ellipsoid-intersect}
\begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\}]
INTERSECT \PYGZhy{} checks if the union or intersection of ellipsoids intersects
            given ellipsoid, hyperplane or Polyhedron.

  resArr = INTERSECT(myEllArr, objArr, mode) \PYGZhy{} Checks if the union
      (mode = \PYGZsq{}u\PYGZsq{}) or intersection (mode = \PYGZsq{}i\PYGZsq{}) of ellipsoids
      in myEllArr intersects with objects in objArr.
      objArr can be array of ellipsoids, array of hyperplanes,
      or array of polyhedrons.
      Ellipsoids, hyperplanes or polyhedrons in objMat must have
      the same dimension as ellipsoids in myEllArr.
      mode = \PYGZsq{}u\PYGZsq{} (default) \PYGZhy{} union of ellipsoids in myEllArr.
      mode = \PYGZsq{}i\PYGZsq{} \PYGZhy{} intersection.

  If we need to check the intersection of union of ellipsoids in
  myEllArr (mode = \PYGZsq{}u\PYGZsq{}), or if myEllMat is a single ellipsoid,
  it can be done by calling distance function for each of the
  ellipsoids in myEllArr and objMat, and if it returns negative value,
  the intersection is nonempty. Checking if the intersection of
  ellipsoids in myEllArr (with size of myEllMat greater than 1)
  intersects with ellipsoids or hyperplanes in objArr is more
  difficult. This problem can be formulated as quadratically
  constrained quadratic programming (QCQP) problem.

  Let objArr(iObj) = E(q, Q) be an ellipsoid with center q and shape
  matrix Q. To check if this ellipsoid intersects (or touches) the
  intersection of ellipsoids in meEllArr: E(q1, Q1), E(q2, Q2), ...,
  E(qn, Qn), we define the QCQP problem:
                    J(x) = \PYGZlt{}(x \PYGZhy{} q), Q\PYGZca{}(\PYGZhy{}1)(x \PYGZhy{} q)\PYGZgt{} \PYGZhy{}\PYGZhy{}\PYGZgt{} min
  with constraints:
                     \PYGZlt{}(x \PYGZhy{} q1), Q1\PYGZca{}(\PYGZhy{}1)(x \PYGZhy{} q1)\PYGZgt{} \PYGZlt{}= 1   (1)
                     \PYGZlt{}(x \PYGZhy{} q2), Q2\PYGZca{}(\PYGZhy{}1)(x \PYGZhy{} q2)\PYGZgt{} \PYGZlt{}= 1   (2)
                     ................................
                     \PYGZlt{}(x \PYGZhy{} qn), Qn\PYGZca{}(\PYGZhy{}1)(x \PYGZhy{} qn)\PYGZgt{} \PYGZlt{}= 1   (n)

  If this problem is feasible, i.e. inequalities (1)\PYGZhy{}(n) do not
  contradict, or, in other words, intersection of ellipsoids
  E(q1, Q1), E(q2, Q2), ..., E(qn, Qn) is nonempty, then we can find
  vector y such that it satisfies inequalities (1)\PYGZhy{}(n) and minimizes
  function J. If J(y) \PYGZlt{}= 1, then ellipsoid E(q, Q) intersects or touches
  the given intersection, otherwise, it does not. To check if E(q, Q)
  intersects the union of E(q1, Q1), E(q2, Q2), ..., E(qn, Qn),
  we compute the distances from this ellipsoids to those in the union.
  If at least one such distance is negative,
  then E(q, Q) does intersect the union.

  If we check the intersection of ellipsoids with hyperplane
  objArr = H(v, c), it is enough to check the feasibility
  of the problem
                      1\PYGZsq{}x \PYGZhy{}\PYGZhy{}\PYGZgt{} min
  with constraints (1)\PYGZhy{}(n), plus
                    \PYGZlt{}v, x\PYGZgt{} \PYGZhy{} c = 0.

  Checking the intersection of ellipsoids with Polyhedron
  objArr = P(A, b) reduces to checking if there any x, satisfying
  constraints (1)\PYGZhy{}(n) and
                       Ax \PYGZlt{}= b.

Input:
  regular:
      myEllArr: ellipsoid [nDims1,nDims2,...,nDimsN] \PYGZhy{} array of
           ellipsoids.
      objArr: ellipsoid / hyperplane /
          / Polyhedron [nDims1,nDims2,...,nDimsN] \PYGZhy{} array of ellipsoids or
          hyperplanes or polyhedrons of the same sizes.

  optional:
      mode: char[1, 1] \PYGZhy{} \PYGZsq{}u\PYGZsq{} or \PYGZsq{}i\PYGZsq{}, go to description.

          note: If mode == \PYGZsq{}u\PYGZsq{}, then mRows, nCols should be equal to 1.

Output:
  resArr: double[nDims1,nDims2,...,nDimsN] \PYGZhy{} return:
      resArr(iCount) = \PYGZhy{}1 in case parameter mode is set
          to \PYGZsq{}i\PYGZsq{} and the intersection of ellipsoids in myEllArr
          is empty.
      resArr(iCount) = 0 if the union or intersection of
          ellipsoids in myEllArr does not intersect the object
          in objArr(iCount).
      resArr(iCount) = 1 if the union or intersection of
          ellipsoids in myEllArr and the object in objArr(iCount)
          have nonempty intersection.
  statusArr: double[0, 0]/double[nDims1,nDims2,...,nDimsN] \PYGZhy{} status
      variable. statusArr is empty if mode = \PYGZsq{}u\PYGZsq{}.

          will be adjusted automatically.

      inputType: char[1,] \PYGZhy{} specifies a way in which the field value is
         partitioned into individual cells before being passed as an
         input parameter to hFunc. This parameter directly corresponds to

                   minDimensionSizeVec exactly i.e. the field takes only
                   scalar values. In such cases no wrapping into cell is
                   performed which allows to get a more transparent
                   output.

    catDim: double[1,1] \PYGZhy{} dimension number for
       concatenating outputs when groupByColumns is false


    replaceNull: logical[1,1], if true, null values from SData are

    nullTopReplacement: \PYGZhy{} can be of any type and currently only applicable
      when  UniformOutput=false and of
      the corresponding column type if UniformOutput=true.

      Note!: this parameter is disregarded for any dataStructure different
         from \PYGZsq{}SData\PYGZsq{}.

      Note!: the main difference between this parameter and the following
         parameters is that nullTopReplacement can violate field type
         constraints thus allowing to replace doubles with strings for
         instance (for non\PYGZhy{}uniform output types only of course)

       if not specified it is assumed that all fields are to be replaced

       the default values

      resCMat: matrix/cell[]  with values of all fields (or
        fields selected by optional arguments) for all CubeStruct
