Summary and Outlook
===================

Although some of the operations with ellipsoids are present in the
commercial Geometric Bounding Toolbox Veres et al. (2001; “Geometric
Bounding Toolbox Homepage”), the ellipsoid-related functionality of that
toolbox is rather limited.

*Ellipsoidal Toolbox* is the first free MATLAB package that implements
ellipsoidal calculus and uses ellipsoidal methods for reachability
analysis of continuous- and discrete-time affine systems,
continuous-time linear systems with disturbances and switched systems,
whose dynamics changes at known times. The reach set computation for
hybrid systems whose guards are hyperplanes or polyhedra is not
implemented explicitly, but the tool for such computation exists,
namely, the operations of intersection of ellipsoid with hyperplane and
ellipsoid with halfspace.
